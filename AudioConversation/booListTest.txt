I don't get sick on planes or trains or long car rides.\"\nJANE: \"That's good. Then you'll probably be ok on the boat.\"\nSARAH: \"Are you really worried about me being seasick?\"\nJANE: \"Yes and there is a reason why.\"\nSARAH: \"What is it?\"\nJANE: \"Tom and I took my friend out on our boat once and she got very sick.
