I loved to read serious books about U.S. presidents.\r\nAnna: In fact, I wanted to be … don’t laugh … President of the United States.\r\nMarsha: (laughs)\r\nAnna: Stop! I know it’s a silly childhood dream.\r\nMarsha: I’m sorry. It’s not silly. Guess what I wanted to be?\r\nAnna: What?\r\nMarsha: I wanted to be... an astronaut.\r\nAnna: Really?\r\nMarsha's Voice: When I was a kid, I studied the stars and planets. I wanted to fly into outer space!\r\nAnna: You know, Marsha, childhood dreams are really important.\r\nMarsha: They are. And it’s good to remember them.\r\nAnna: Hey! I have an idea. Let’s go.\r\nMarsha: Go where?\r\nAnna: Let’s go make our childhood dreams come true.\r\nMarsha: We’re going to the Air & Space Museum! Yes!\r\nAnna: No. We’re going to see a show at Ford’s Theatre just like Abraham Lincoln did when he died! It’s not far from here.\r\nMarsha: Uh huh. That is your childhood dream.\r\nAnna: Good point. Okay, next week, we'll come here and be astronauts.\r\nMarsha: Honestly?\r\nAnna: Honestly.\r\nAnna: Tonight we are seeing a show at Ford’s Theatre, where a man shot President Abraham Lincoln.

You know, it’s not easy to be a writer.\nAnna: Yeah, I heard that. Sorry.\nPete: But this job is great. I work outside by the river. And I can eat all the free seafood I want!\nAnna: That is great, Pete. In fact, I am here to buy some seafood for my dinner party.\nPete: You came to the right place. They have the freshest seafood in town. How much money can you spend?\nAnna: I can only spend $50.\nPete: Okay. What do you want?\nAnna: First, I want to buy some shrimp.\nPete: Sure thing. Follow me. How much shrimp do you want?\nAnna: How much do I need for five people?\nPete: (yells to co-worker) Give her a pound of shrimp!\nAnna: Ok, now I want to buy some crabs.\nPete: The crabs here are delicious! They are the best because they come from the nearby Chesapeake Bay! Walk this way.\nPete: How many crabs do you want?\nAnna: I want a dozen crabs.\nPete: You should get the larger crabs. They have the most meat.\nAnna: Then I want a dozen large crabs, please!\nPete: Is that everything you need?\nAnna: Let’s see … I have shrimp and crabs. And a friend is bringing a salad and many ears of corn-on-the-cob.\nPete: Is that all the seafood that you need?\nAnna: Yes.\nPete: That’ll be $49.95. Cash or credit?\nAnna: Credit, please.\nPete: Anna, you love to eat seafood. Did you grow up on the water?\nAnna: No, I didn’t. But I love the water. And I love being on the water.\nPete: You know how to sail?\nAnna: Well … this afternoon I am going on a boat.\nPete: You are full of surprises. What kind of boat? Is it a motorboat or a sailboat?\nAnna: It’s a special boat, Pete. Well, thanks for your help. See you later!\nPete: See you, Anna! Wow, Anna’s a sailor! Who knew?\nAnna: Yes, rivers are important to the history and culture of Washington, D.C. And now I am part of this city’s interesting waterfront culture. Until next time!",

But I really want to watch a baseball game. Does anyone have an extra ticket?\r\nFan: Next time, you should buy your ticket online.\r\nAnna: Thanks. Thanks a lot. It is good advice.

There is more culture in the city and there might be more jobs. But the country has more nature! It's peaceful and beautiful. There are more trees and mountains. The air is clean. You can go hiking and camping. The city is not beautiful. It's noisy and dirty.\r\nAnna: I disagree. I think all the different buildings are beautiful. And I like to watch all the different people.\r\nPhil: That's another thing that is different. People in the country are friendly. They always say \"hello!\" Here, no one says \"hello.\" I think city people are rude.\r\nAnna: Well, I agree. Country people are friendly. But I don't think city people are rude. I think they're just busy.\r\nPhil: That's a good point.\r\nAnna: Look at me. I live in the city and I said \"hello\" to you.\r\nPhil: But you are from the country.\r\nAnna: I have an idea. Let's say \"hello!\" to people -- to many people!\r\nPhil: What? Why?\r\nAnna: Well, if we say \"hello,\" maybe they will say \"hello\" to other people ... Hello!\r\nPhil: ... and they will say \"hello\" to more people! That's a great idea! I'm glad you found my bag.\r\nAnna: Come on. Let's go say \"hello\" to people.\r\nAnna: We don't have to agree with people. They have their opinions. We have ours. And as we like to say, you can always agree to disagree! Until next time...! Hello!\r\nListen to short videos and test your listening skills with this quiz.",

We played in that old treehouse behind my family’s house for hours!\r\nAnna: I forgot about that! We thought it really time traveled! Penelope, it is really good to talk to you. New friends are good. But old friends are the best.\r\nPenelope: I know. Our hometown isn’t the same now. You are not there.\r\nAnna: No crying. Why don't you move here and live with me and Marsha?\r\nPenelope: Anna, I can’t leave our hometown. You forget -- I love my job, too.\r\nAnna: I didn’t forget.

Let’s go eat dinner at one of D.C.’s most famous restaurants.\r\nPenelope: Awesome!\r\nAnna: That’s the restaurant, Penelope. I’ll be right there.\r\nAnna: I have a great apartment. I love my work.

I want to see New York City and the Statue of Liberty!\r\nMarsha: And I want to see Mount Rushmore!\r\nAnna: (Anna writes) Mount Rushmore.\r\nMarsha: And don’t forget the Grand Canyon!\r\nAnna: (Anna writes) Let’s not forget California’s redwood forest!

We littered! And my list is gone. Don't worry. I brought the book. (lifts up large book, starts reading)\r\n(Later)\r\nAnna: … and that is why I am so afraid of sheep.\r\nMarsha: (snores a little)\r\nAnna: Wow, I feel better. Marsha, you are a great listener.\r\nMarsha: (waking up) Where are we?\r\nAnna: We will be entering North Dakota any minute now!\r\nMarsha: North Dakota! We are going in the wrong direction! We want to go to South Dakota!\r\nAnna: No problem. I will just exit the highway. We will be going south … in just a minute. There. Done! We're going south! Okay, we will be stopping for gas and a bathroom break in about an hour.\r\nMarsha: Then we will be very near to Mount Rushmore!\r\nAnna: Yay! Dead presidents’ heads on the side of a mountain!\r\nAnna: We did it, Marsha! We made it to California!

Spies use their brains.\r\nAnna: Got it! I’ve never cracked a code before. Let’s try, Agent Flamingo! This is really hard. I'm still trying to crack the code. I've cracked the code! I've cracked the code, Agent Peacock! My brain really hurts.\r\nMs. Weaver: Great. Umm, Agent Flamingo, now answer this question: Do spies have to be in good shape?\r\nAnna: “Yes,” Agent Peacock!

Sorry I'm late, but the snow storm made getting here really difficult. I see you’ve been waiting very patiently. So, let’s get started! Who wants to give their talk first?\r\nAnna: Oh! Oh! Please, please pick me.\r\nDr. Jones: Anna?\r\nAnna: Who me? Sure. Thanks.\r\nAnna: Here is my report on “Violins in the City.”\r\nAnna: People have been looking for a solution to the problem of violins in the city. I say stop! Stop! They are not the problem! In fact, violins are part of the solution!\r\nAnna: Violins create beautiful music that can fill a city with hope.\r\nDr. Jones: Anna …\r\nAnna: If we put a violin in the hands of every child …\r\nDr. Jones: Anna! The topic is “Violence in the city.” Violence. Not violins.\r\nAnna: Until next time …Like I was saying, many people are saying that violence in the city is a problem. A very big problem.",

Does this have anything to do with your big news?\r\nAnna: Yes. Yes, it does.\r\nKelly: Well, Anna, please share that news with us.\r\nAnna: Kelly, I will be acting in three movies.\r\nKelly: That is amazing! Anna, tell us more.\r\nAnna: Well, the first is a science fiction movie. The second is a romantic comedy. And the third is an action movie.\r\nKelly: That is so great! Let me guess -- you’re playing a tree in all of them!\r\nAnna: Yes! This is what happened. To prepare for your play, I had to find out what it was like to BE a tree in the world. I had to find out where to eat, where to shop, where to meet people and how to get around the city.\r\nKelly: Amazing. I think big things are going to happen for you, Anna. So, tell me, will you be moving to Hollywood for a career in movies?\r\nAnna: No. I’ll make the movies and then come back. Washington, D.C. is my home.\r\nKelly: I’m sure your family is very proud.\r\nAnna: Yes, they are. You know, Kelly, not too long ago, I didn’t feel very good about my life. I had to make a change. So, I took some chances. Sometimes I succeeded. Sometimes I failed. But I will never stop trying.\r\nKelly: Well, thank you for sharing your news and so much more with us, Anna.\r\nKelly: Until next time …",
