I have read many books about time management, and most of them recommend making a schedule and following it as closely as possible.\n\nInterviewer: What do you do if something unexpected comes up?\n\nGreg: If that happens, then you simply add it to your schedule. At the end of each day, I sit down and look at my schedule for the next day. If there is anything that needs to be added, then I modify the schedule.\n\nInterviewer: Does this work for you?\n\nGreg: It has helped me very much.

What are you doing to improve your weakness?\nTina: As you know, technology is constantly being updated and changing. So, it is important for people in our field to stay up to date with the latest technologies. I often fall behind on this because I become too focused on whatever project I am working on. In order to fix this, I set aside one hour every day to study new technology.\n\nInterviewer: What time of day do you do that?\n\nTina: I do it every morning from 8 to 9, right before I start work. I like to sit in the coffee shop on the 1st floor and have my morning coffee while I study a little bit.\n\nInterviewer: That’s great. Do you ever miss a day because you are too busy or too tired?\n\nTina: Of course, I do, but I have a rule. The rule is that if I miss a day during the week, then I need to make it up on the weekend. For example, I wasn’t able to study this Wednesday because I had a dentist appointment, so I will study for at least one hour this Saturday.\n\nInterviewer: That’s a good rule.",

So, the first thing I do is gather information. I do research, talk to people, or whatever I have to do to get the information. Second, I like to make a list of the advantages and disadvantages. This helps me think and it makes the decision less subjective. Last, if I have time, then I like to give myself a couple of days to think about it before I make my final decision.\n\nInterviewer: Would you say that decision-making is one of your strengths?\n\nMark: Yes, I would. I have read many books and taken a few classes about how to make good decisions. I think the decision-making process is something that everyone can study and benefit from.\n\nInterviewer: Do you feel comfortable making quick decisions under pressure?\n\nMark: Yes, I have no problem working under pressure.

I like to compete, but I prefer to compete with my team members not against them. The best feeling is when my team succeeds and my company does well because of work that I was involved in.\n\nInterviewer: That is good to hear.",

When colleagues do not finish their work on time, I can get a little annoyed and impatient.\n\nInterviewer: Did this happen a lot at your last job?\n\nKaren: It happened quite often. I am the kind of person who always finishes their work on time, but other people at my last job did not worry about deadlines very much.\n\nInterviewer: How did you handle that kind of situation?\n\nKaren: I just approached them in a friendly way and I explained that I was waiting for them to finish their work. I did not criticize them. I think it is important to avoid criticizing people because people often become defensive when you criticize them and it doesn’t help the situation.\n\nInterviewer: Did anyone ever get angry at you?\n\nKaren: Never. If I ever felt like somebody was becoming upset or defensive, then I ended the conversation. After a while, they usually calmed down and came to talk to me.",

I listened to everybody, thought about it for a while, and then I made my decision. After I made my decision, I explained my reasons to everybody.\n\nInterviewer: How did everyone react?\n\nAbby: Of course, some people disagreed.

Occasionally, I had to write an email in English or participate in a conference call in English.\n\nInterviewer: Well, in this job, you will need to use English daily. Would you feel comfortable doing that?\n\nJon: Absolutely. I have been preparing for a position like this for years. I’ve been taking an English class every weekday for 2 years, and I study English on my own every day. One of the main reasons that I am applying for this job is that I want a chance to use my English skills in business.\n\nInterviewer: I see. It seems like your English is perfect.\n\nJon: Thank you very much. I am happy to hear you say that because I have put a lot of time and effort into learning English.\n\nInterviewer: So, what is your native language?\n\nJon: I grew up in Colombia, so my first language is Spanish, but I have been learning English since I was in elementary school.

We all worked together on every part of the project, but the person with the most experience or skill took the lead for certain parts.\n\nInterviewer: And what was your part?\n\nGreg: I was the best writer on the team, so I wrote all of the advertisements, promotions, and reports. My teammates gave me feedback, and together we created some great work. On the other hand, I also contributed and helped them with their parts which were design, pricing, and products.\n\nInterviewer: That’s great. Working on a team is very important to our company.",

I was promoted to manager after two years. Around the same time that I became a manager, I also started attending classes at the local college. In 2009, I got my bachelor’s degree in marketing, and I left my position at McDonald’s and I started working for Ford Motors in the marketing department. And I have been working there ever since.\n\nInterviewer: Was it difficult to work full time and go to school?\n\nKevin: To be honest, it was difficult. But I was highly motivated. I knew that I did not want to work in a fast food restaurant for the rest of my life, so I pushed myself every day.\n\nInterviewer: What did you learn from your time as a manager at McDonald’s?\n\nKevin: I learned a lot and I am grateful to McDonald’s for the opportunity they gave me. During that time, I learned how to deal with all kinds of people. I also learned a lot about time management.\n\nInterviewer: It sounds like you got a lot of good experience.",

However, he didn’t want to make anyone angry, so he often avoided making these decisions.\n\nInterviewer: I see. How did that affect the performance of the department?\n\nMark: It affected our performance greatly. We often fell behind schedule because he couldn’t make a decision and many times we did not have clear directions from him, so the quality of the projects fell.\n\nInterviewer: That must have been frustrating.\n\nMark: It definitely was a little frustrating.",
