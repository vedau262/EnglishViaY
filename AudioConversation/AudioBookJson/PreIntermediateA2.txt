        "dialog": "Hi, everyone. I know you're all busy so I'll keep this briefing quick. I have some important information about a change in the management team. As you already know, our head of department, James Watson, is leaving his position at the end of this week. His replacement is starting at the end of the next month. In the meantime, we'll continue with our projects as usual.\n\nI have two more quick points. Firstly, there will be some improvements made to the staff car park next month for a few weeks. It will be closed during that time.\n\nDon't worry, we've found a solution. We can use the local church car park until our own one is ready. If you arrive before 8.30 a.m., please use our small car park on Brown Street, and if you arrive after that, you should go directly to the church car park. It's only a five-minute walk away. But they need it in the evenings, so you have to leave before 6 p.m. Sorry about that – I know how much you all love working late!\n\nThe other thing I wanted to tell you about is that the canteen has now introduced a cashless payment system. So, you can't use cash for payments any more. You can pay directly with your smartphone or you can pay using your company ID card. The total amount put on your company ID card comes off your salary at the end of each month.\n\nOK. That's it? Are there any questions?",

I'm organising a little party for my birthday. It's nothing very big – only a few of my best and closest friends. That means you too! We're going to have it at my cousin's house. She lives in the countryside in a nice big house with a swimming pool. I'd love to see you there. It's going to be this Friday. I'll send you the instructions on how to get there later, OK? \n\nAnyway, have fun at work. Do not work too hard, OK? Talk soon.\n\nAutomated message: You have two new messages. Message number two, received today at 5.15 p.m.\n\nAw, you're still not answering your phone! OK, here are the instructions to get to my cousin's house for the party. Are you going to take your car? If you take the car, drive straight on Forest Road until you get to the motorway. Drive past Brownsville and take exit 13A. That's 13A. You drive down the road there and turn left. It's the first big house on the right. OK? If you're taking a bus, you can get the number 80 to Brownsville. Call me when you get there and somebody can pick you up in a car. I can't wait. This is going to be so great!",

Let's learn a little bit about the canal itself, before we look at how it connects to everything else.\r\n\r\nThe Panama Canal is an artificial waterway in the Central American country of Panama that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. It is only 82 kilometres long. If you go around South America by ship then you need to travel another 15,000 kilometres. So the canal saves a lot of travel time. It takes around 8 to 10 hours to cross the canal.\r\n\r\nThe French started building the canal in 1881, but they couldn't finish it. The project was started again in 1904 by the United States and the canal was finally finished in 1914. Many people died while they were building the canal, some say up to 25,000. For the rest of the 20th century, the United States controlled the canal, but gave control back to Panama in 2000.\r\n\r\nEvery year, around 40,000 ships come through the canal. These are mostly commercial ships. They transport goods for trade between Asia and America, or Europe. In 2016 the government of Panama made the canal bigger, so that now 99 per cent of ships can pass through it.\r\n\r\nLet's now turn to the role of the Panama Canal in the global economy …",

At the end I asked them, 'What happens now?', and the woman said, 'We'll call you back with news in three or four days.'\n\nMan: Really?\n\nWoman: Yeah, I think I've got the job.

And selfies.\n\nMan: Wait a minute. You can take photos while you're in there?\n\nWoman: Yes, but you can't use flash. I don't know ... Why do we take photos of everything we see when we travel?\n\nMan: I know. And we never look at the photos after.\n\nWoman: Exactly! I'm tired of always taking photos.

Do you remember Barry?\n\nWoman: No.\n\nMan: Yes, YES! You do remember. Barry, your boyfriend at high school. You were seventeen and he was sixteen and he was so very polite: 'Hello, I'm Barry.

You don't want me in the group?\n\nWoman: No, no. It isn't that. It's that we've already made the group, see? There's four of us already.\n\nMan: So? We can't be a group of five?\n\nWoman: Well, the teacher said four people per group.\n\nMan: Oh.\n\nWoman: It's not about you or your work or anything like that.

Email is better for the trees and for me.\r\n\r\nDon't forget that you must reference every idea or quote you use that isn't your own idea. And the last page of your essay should be a list of all the books you used, in alphabetical order, not in the order you used them!\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, make it easy for me to read! That means use a clear font. Arial is best, but Times New Roman is fine too. Not Comic Sans please! Size 12 font for the essay, and size 14 for the titles and subheadings. And use page numbers.

What do you want to know?\n\nStudent: OK … I hope this isn't a silly question, but what does Fibonacci actually mean?\n\nProfessor: No question is ever silly – it's always good to ask. OK, it's the name of a person. Fibonacci was a European mathematician in the Middle Ages.\n\nStudent: Ah, OK. Thanks. So, we know he was a person, but what are the Fibonacci numbers? I don't get it.\n\nProfessor: The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers. They go 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and so on. Do you see the sequence? Do you see how it works?\n\nStudent: I'm not sure.\n\nProfessor: OK. This is how it works. The first number is 1, then 1 again, then 2. The third number is the first number plus the second number. The fourth number is the second number plus the third number: 1 plus 2 is 3. The fifth number is the third number, 2, plus the fourth number, 3. So the fifth number in a Fibonacci sequence is 5.\n\nStudent: Ah! I think I understand now. But what about their importance? You said these were very important.\n\nProfessor: Yes, let me explain. This sequence of numbers is important because we see it in many things. Fibonacci numbers are common in geometry, they are common in nature, for example in plants. We see the sequence everywhere.\n\nStudent: Could you give us some more examples?\n\nProfessor: OK ... well, we don't have time right now but I can bring more examples in for next class, OK?",

She's the one with short, dark hair.\n\nYuki: In the purple dress?\n\nJani: Yeah, that's right. You'll probably work closely with her while you are learning about our ordering process.\n\nYuki: Got it, thanks. And who's that over there? The guy who's on the phone?\n\nJani: Oh, you mean the one by the window? In the green shirt? Ah, that's Ian. He's the marketing director. And that's Maria beside him. She's responsible for the internal IT systems.\n\nYuki: OK, I'll try to remember all of this. I should probably be taking notes!\n\nJani: Don't worry about it. For now it's just good to put some faces to names.\n\nYuki: OK, great – and who do I talk to about setting up my mobile phone with email access? Is that also Maria?\n\nJani: No, you need to talk to Sebastian who works in communications. He can help you. That's him over there, next to the printer.  \n\nYuki: Thanks. I'll introduce myself to him later.",
