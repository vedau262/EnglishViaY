Why are you going there?\n\nI want to buy a new computer.\n\nOK, are you driving?\n\nYes.\n\nGo straight down this road. When you get to the second light, take a left. Then get on the highway and take exit 52.\n\nThat sounds really complicated. Can you tell me again? Which road do I take first?\n\nYou go down this road, then at the second light, turn left. That road is Main street.\n\nOK, I think I've got it now.\n\nWhy are you buying a new computer anyway? Didn't you just get one a few months ago?\n\nYes, but it doesn't work anymore.\n\nWhere did you buy it?\n\nAt Wal–Mart.\n\nI think you're computer should still be under warranty. You can bring it back to them and they'll fix it for free.\n\nI think you're right. I didn't think about that. I should go talk to them about it. Where is the closest Wal–Mart?\n\nIt's about 2 blocks from here. I have to go there to get some stuff now anyway. Do you want to follow me?\n\nSure.\n",

I've been taking English courses for 12 years now.\n\nWow, that's interesting. I remember when we took that trip last year and visited your family. It seemed like there weren't many people that could speak with me in English.\n\nOh, that's because they don't speak English that much.\n\nBut they speak it in school, right? Maybe they just didn't like me so they didn't want to talk to me.\n\nNo, actually they liked you a lot. They told me they thought you were very nice. They are just shy. They're not use to talking with foreigners. I remember when I first came to the US. I was really nervous about speaking with people.\n\nI see. I thought there were lots of Americans teaching English in your country.\n\nYes, that's true. There are probably twice as many now as there were five years ago, but they are mostly in the cities. My family lives in the country.\n\nI wonder why. Personally I prefer the country to the city. It's so quiet and peaceful. If I were to teach, I would want to teach in the country.\n\nDo you think you would want to teach someday? I know the schools around my town are looking for teachers, so if you want, I can call them and get more information.\n\nNo, I don't think so. I would need to stay there for a year, and I don't think I can take that much time off work.\n\nWell, if you change your mind, let me know. I think you would be a really great teacher.\n\n",
