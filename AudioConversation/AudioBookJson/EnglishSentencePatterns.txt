        "dialog": "And is used to connect two or more similar words or ideas.\n\nWe can use “and” between adjectives or nouns.\n\nShe is tall and pretty.\nHe was a writer and a painter.\nWe can use “and” to connect two shorter sentences. This helps us make longer sentences.\n\nSentence 1, + and + sentence 2\n\nHe is a talented basketball player, and he is also a great baseball player.\nShe works here in the morning, and she works there at night.\nWe can use different verb tenses even in the same sentence.\n\nI am tired today, and I will probably be tired tomorrow.\nThis pizza restaurant was terrible last time, and it is terrible this time, too!\nWe can also use “and” when we want to show that two things happen, happened, or will happen at the same time.\n\nI studied, and she watched TV.\nHe does his homework and he listens to music in the evening.\nWe can also use “and then” to show the order of events. “Then” is optional, but we should use it when the meaning is not clear without it.\n\nAction 1 + and (then) + action 2\n\nHe read a book and went to bed.\nWe ate and left.\nI will go to France, and then I will go to Germany.\nShe gave her opinion and then sat down.\nWe can also use “and” to show a repeated action.\n\nHe coughed and coughed.\nThe children laughed and laughed.\nMy boss just talks and talks and talks during meetings.\nBonus Tips and Points\n\n1. We should use a comma before “and” when “and” is used between two sentences. These sentences will have two subjects.\n\nThey went to the gym, and I went to the movie theater.\nMark works at a car company, and Bill works at a marketing firm.\nShe made cookies, and he made a cake.\nMary went to the store, and then she went to the bank.\n2. If the subject of both sentences is the same, then we do not need to repeat it. When we do this, we do not need to use a comma.\n\nShe works and listens to music.\n(=She works, and she listens to music.)\n \n\nMark came to our house and helped us.\n(=Mark came to our house, and he helped us.)\n \n\nShe came for 10 minutes and then left.\n(=She came for 10 minutes, and then she left.)\n3. We only use “and” one time when we are listing nouns, adjectives, and prepositional phrases. We use “and” between the last two words.\n\nShe went to Japan, Korea, China, Singapore, Malaysia, and Cambodia.\nHe is funny, nice, and handsome.\nI looked for my phone in the car, in my bedroom, in the bathroom, and at my office.",

        "dialog": "This kind of question is always used to ask about the future. They have the same meaning as questions with “will”.\n\nWill you go? = Are you going to go?\nWill it rain today? = Is it going to rain today?\nIf the question begins with a “be verb” (am/is/are), then it is a yes/no question. So, the answer will either be yes or no.\n\nA) Are you going to play soccer today?\nB) Yes, I am going to play soccer.\n\nA) Is it going to snow today?\nB) No, it isn’t.\n\nBe verb + subject + going + infinitive…?\n\nIs she going to visit her family on Christmas?\nAre you going to come to the party?\nIs Mark going to tell his girlfriend the truth?\nIs the company going to fire some employees?\nAre we going to finish before 9 p.m.?\nAre they going to break up?\nIt is also possible to use an adjective, noun, or prepositional phrase after “going to”. We just need to use the verb “to be”.\n\nBe verb + subject + going to be…?\n\nIs it going to be cold tomorrow?\nAre they going to be ready soon?\nIs he going to be a lawyer?\nAre Tony and Sally going to be okay?\nAm I going to be fired?\nUse the same pattern for the passive voice.\n\nIs the company going to be sold?\nAre the old computers going to be fixed?\nIs the dog going to be fed?\nBonus Tips and Points\n\n1. “Going to + verb” and “will” are very similar. Many times, we can use either one and they have exactly the same meaning.\n\nI am going to study hard.\n(=I will study hard.)\n \n\nIt is going to be hot today.\n(=It will be hot today.)\nWe cannot use “going to + verb”, we can only use “will” when the speaker has decided to do something at the time of speaking. They did not decide before.\n\nA) Let’s leave.\nB) Good idea. I will get our coats.\n\nHowever, it is very common to use “going to + verb” to talk about plans and intentions. We use this for things that we have already decided. These things are usually in the near future.\n\nI am going to visit my mother next weekend.\nShe is going to buy a new house in 3 years.\nWe are going to get a puppy after we get married.\nThey are going to see a movie tonight.\nHe is going to quit his job next year.",

        "dialog": "A “be verb” can also be followed by a prepositional phrase. We can use these sentences in many different ways.\n\nHere are some common prepositions that we will use with these kinds of sentences.\n\nat                       in                     on\nnext to              near                under\nabove               from                with\n\nThese usually tell the time or location of someone or something.\n\n\nSubject + be verb + prepositional phrase…\n\nI am from America.\nThe cat is on the bed.\nThe concert is at 10 pm.\nThe child is under the tree.\nThe picture of my father is above the fireplace.\nBen is with his girlfriend at the restaurant.\nThe bank is near the hospital.\nMark is in the coffee shop.\nMary is at school now.\nWe can make the sentence negative by using “be verb + not” or the contraction form.\n\nHe is not at home right now.\nThey are not from England. They are from Australia.\nOur office isn’t next to the subway station.\nMark is not at the party. Do you know where he is?\nThe books aren’t on the desk.\nWe can use this sentence pattern with other verbs tenses like past tense or future tense.\n\nThe dog was not in the house.\nThe children were not at the park.\nMy co-worker was not at her desk this morning.\nThe show was not at 10 pm, it was at 9 pm.\nI was not with Bill. I was alone.\nHe will be on TV soon.\nShe has been at work for 18 hours.\nBonus Tips and Points\n\n1. We also use prepositional phrases a lot with sentences that start with “there”. We use these sentences to show what exists or does not exist in a place.\n\nThere + be verb + noun…\n\nThere is a bug on your face.\nThere are presents under the Christmas tree.\nThere is a pharmacy next to the bank.\nThere were 3 dogs in the garden this morning.\nThere are many children on the playground.\nThere is an empty cup on the table.\nThere is a banana on the book.\nThere are two laptops on the desk.\nThere are no clouds in the sky.\nThere was a good movie on TV last night.\nThere was an interesting story in yesterday’s paper.\nThere are many good books on your bookshelf.",

        "dialog": "We use the word “because” to give a reason or cause. It tells us why.\n\nWe usually use “because” in the middle of a sentence. It connects and makes two shorter sentences into one longer sentence.\n\nAction/Result + because + reason/cause\n\nBoth parts should be full sentences. They both need a subject and a verb.\n\nThe boy didn`t go to school last week because he was sick.\nI don`t want to buy it because it is too expensive.\nShe won`t come to the party because she has a lot of work to do.\nThe house doesn`t look good because the paint color is ugly.\nWe will not go on a picnic because it is raining.\nNote: We can mix the verb tenses. For example, the action/result can be in the present tense, but the reason/cause can be in the past tense.\n\nIt is also possible to use “because” at the beginning of a sentence.\n\nBecause + reason/cause, action/result\n\nUse a comma to separate the reason or cause from the action or result when writing.\n\nBecause it is cold, let`s stay home today.\nBecause the jacket was too expensive, she didn`t buy it.\nBecause she is always kind, I like her.\nNote: Many grammar books tell us not to put “because” at the beginning of a sentence when writing. However, there are many people who do not follow this rule. Sometimes, I use “because” at the beginning of a sentence.\n\nSometimes, just a noun can explain why. We use this a lot when the listener can easily understand without a lot of details.\n\nAction/Result + because of + noun\nBecause of + noun, action\n\nI don`t like school because of my teacher.\nWe didn`t go hiking because of the weather.\nBecause of the price, he didn`t buy the car.\nBecause of her, I hate working here.\nBonus Tips and Points\n\n1. We can use different verb tenses (present tense, past tense, future tense, etc.).\n\nShe will go tomorrow because she didn`t have time today.\nThey went today because tomorrow will be busier.\nI finished my work today because I want to go fishing tomorrow.\n2. We often use short sentences to answer “why” questions. We can leave out the part that was already mentioned in the question. This is very common when speaking.\n\nA) Why didn`t you come to work yesterday?\nB) Because I was sick.\n\nA) Why isn`t the TV working?\nB) Because it is not plugged in!\n\nA) Why will you quit your job?\nB) Because I want to try something new.\n\nReal-World English Conversations\n\nA) I need to leave early because I have to go to the hospital.\nB) Why do you need to go to the hospital?\nA) Because my brother is in the hospital right now.\n\nA) What should I get my wife for her birthday?\nB) You should get her jewelry because all women love jewelry.\nA) Actually, my wife doesn`t wear jewelry.\nB) Well, then I have no idea what you should do.\n\nA) We need to leave for the airport no later than 8 am.\nB) Why do we need to leave so early?\nA) We need to leave early because traffic is always bad at that time.\n\nA) I don`t want to go out today because of the weather.\nB) Okay. Let`s just stay in and order a pizza.\nA) That sounds good, but I don`t want to order a pizza because I am on a diet.\nB) No problem. We can eat something else.",

They offer a high salary for a reason. You just need to decide what you want.\n\n4. We can also put “but” at the beginning of a sentence.\n\nHe is very handsome. But he does not have a girlfriend.\nI like avocados and they are healthy. But they are too expensive where I live.\nNote: Many people avoid using “but” at the beginning of a sentence when they write, but it is not a problem if you do it sometimes. If you want to avoid using “but”, then just use the word “however” at the beginning of a sentence. It has the same meaning.",

        "dialog": "This is a phrase that usually goes at the beginning of a sentence. It shows that something is surprising or unexpected but true. We usually use this when we think that the listener doesn`t know or will be surprised by what we say.\n\nSituation: There are two sisters. They are different in every way. They look different, they act different, they speak differently, etc. Nobody would expect that they are sisters.\n\nIf this is the case, then we can say something like this to somebody who knows the two women but does not know that they are sisters.\n\nBelieve it or not, they are sisters.\nWhen we say this, we think that the listener will be surprised or might not believe it.\n\nThis phrase is 100% optional.\n\nBelieve it or not, they are sisters. = They are sisters.\nWithout this phrase, a sentence still has all the most important information. This phrase only adds feeling to a sentence. There are many phrases like this in English. I call these phrases “sentence starters” because they usually go at the beginning of a sentence.\n\nBelieve it or not, + surprising/unexpected fact\n\nBelieve it or not, I do not exercise.\n(Says a man with huge muscles and a good body)\nBelieve it or not, I eat a lot of food.\n(Says a very skinny woman)\nBelieve it or not, he is the CEO of that company.\n(Talking about a very young-looking man who is dressed casually)\nBelieve it or not, he is a kindergarten teacher.\n(Talking about a man who does not look like he works with children)\nBelieve it or not, the hotel in the picture was not very expensive.\n(Talking about a hotel that looks very nice and expensive)\nBonus Tips and Points\n\n1. We can add this phrase at the end of a sentence. We usually only do this when speaking.\n\nThat tall guy is my brother, believe it or not.\nThey look like sisters, but the woman in the red dress is actually the other woman`s mother, believe it or not.\nMy brother loves ballet, believe it or not.\n2. We can also use the word “actually” to show that something is surprising but true. It is more common to use “actually” when responding to what another person said.\n\nA) He looks scary.\nB) Actually, he is a school teacher and a very nice man.\n(=Believe it or not, he is a school teacher and a very nice man.)\n\nA) How could you afford a new car?\nB) Actually, I won the lottery.\n(=Believe it or not, I won the lottery.)\n\n3. This is a good phrase to know, but we do not want to overuse it. We should not use it every time we say something that the listener does not know.\n\nReal-World English Conversations\n\nA) Believe it or not, I got the job!\nB) Congratulations! You said that you weren`t going to get the job.\nA) I didn`t think that I would. I was very surprised when I got the call.\n\nA) How old is your daughter?\nB) Believe it or not, she is already 3 years old.\nA) Wow! Time flies.\n\nA) Did you get fired for yelling at your boss?\nB) Believe it or not, I didn`t get fired. I actually got a raise.\nA) I don`t believe it.\n\nA) Believe it or not, Google just offered to buy my company.\nB) That`s amazing. Are you going to sell it?\nA) I think so, but I should think about it some more before I make a final decision.\n\nA) Is he a high school student?\nB) He is 40 years old, believe it or not. He just looks really young.",

        "dialog": "We use these kinds of questions to ask about things that did not actually happen in the past. Remember that “could (not) have + past participle” is always used to talk about things that were or were not possible in the past, but did not actually happen.\n\nWe couldn`t have finished if Jon hadn`t helped.\n(=Really, we finished because Jon helped.)\nIf Mark hadn`t quit he could have won.\n(=Really, Mark quit and he did not win.)\nIt is also possible to use “could have + past participle” to talk about possibilities in the past. We do not know exactly what happened. We are guessing or giving possibilities.\n\nA) Where is Tina?\nB) She could have gone home. Or, she could have gone to the store.\n\nWe can use these questions in the same two ways.\n\nCould + subject + have + past participle…?\n\nIt is also possible to put this in the middle of the question.\n\nA) Could you have come if you weren`t sick?\nB) Yes, but I was sick, so I couldn`t come.\n\nA) Where is Sally? Could she have gone home?\nB) It is possible. Sometimes, she leaves work early.\n\nA) Before he left, could he have stolen the report?\nB) I don`t think that is possible. He is a good guy.\n\nA) Could she have gotten the job if her uncle wasn`t the CEO?\nB) I don`t think so. I don`t think she is qualified for the job.\n\nA) Could you have done anything differently?\nB) I have thought about it a lot. I don`t think I could`ve done anything differently.\n\nA) If you had studied more, could you have passed the test?\nB) Honestly, I don`t think so. The test was so difficult.\n\nA) Could anything have been done to prevent the accident?\nB) If they had followed the safety regulations, it could have been avoided.\n\nBonus Tips and Points\n\n1. We can use negative questions when we think another person made a mistake and we want to indirectly tell them what they should have done or ask them why they did not do something.\n\nA) Couldn`t you have called me if you knew you were going to be late?\nB) You are right. I should have called you. I am sorry.\n\nA) Sorry. I couldn`t look over the report last night. I was too busy.\nB) Couldn`t you have come to work early to finish it?\n\n2. We also make very similar sentences and questions with “would have” and “might/may have”. We can use the same sentence and question patterns as we do with “could have”.\n\nWould you have known that if I hadn`t told you?\nWould you have won if she were not on your team?\nHe might have gone home or he might have gone out to get some food.\nJon may have taken the key. I will call him and find out.\nReal-World English Conversations\n\nA) If I had known that you would be late, I could`ve slept longer.\nB) I`m sorry about that. It took me a long time to get ready this morning.\nA) Couldn`t you have called me and told me?\nB) I didn`t think of it. I`ll definitely do it next time. Again, I`m sorry.\n\nA) How did you get here?\nB) I took a taxi from downtown.\nA) Why did you do that? I could have given you a ride.\nB) I didn`t want to bother you. It was no big deal.\n\nA) Sue was in town last weekend, but she didn`t call me.\nB) I thought you two were good friends.\nA) I thought so too. I know she was busy, but she could have at least called to say hello.\nB) You`re right. Or she could have at least made a little time to meet and have a coffee with you.\n\nA) What happened to you?\nB) I fell down the stairs because I was on my phone.\nA) Are you okay?\nB) For the most part. I only hurt my arm a little bit.\nA) You need to be more careful. You could have killed yourself. Make sure that you pay attention when you are going downstairs and get off your phone!",

        "dialog": "This sentence pattern is used to strongly tell somebody not to do something. Not only are we telling them not to do it, but we are also telling them not to think about doing it.\n\nWe use this pattern to warn people.\n\nDon`t even think about saying anything. I will kill you if you do!\nDon`t even think about touching my sandwich!\nDon`t even think about smoking. I`ll punch you if you smoke.\nWe can also it to give advice.\n\nDon`t even think about your ex-boyfriend. You will find a better guy soon.\nDon`t even think about the test results.

We can also make present tense sentences. These sentences show what a person does not think about.\n\nWe usually say this when a person used to think about something a lot, but now does not.\n\nI don`t even think about my ex-girlfriend anymore.\nShe doesn`t even think about her hometown anymore.\nWe don`t even think about moving to a new city anymore. It is impossible.\nWe also use it when something is so crazy, outrageous, or unthinkable, that the thought of doing it never pops into a person`s head.\n\nThey don`t even think about reporting their boss` bad behavior.\nI don`t even think about telling my wife to lose weight. She would kill me.\n2. We can also use the present perfect tense to make similar sentences. These sentences show that a particular action has not been thought about or considered by a person or group of people.\n\nWe haven`t even thought about hiring a new supplier.\nShe hasn`t even thought about selling her apartment.\nReal-World English Conversations\n\nA) Can I have that cookie?\nB) No!

        "dialog": "We use this sentence pattern to talk about an action or result that would be unexpected or surprising if it happened. It is similar to “even though”.\n\n“Even though” is used for an action or situation that is currently true or was true in the past.\n\nEven though I studied, I failed.\nEven though I am studying, I think I will fail.\n“Even if” is used for an action or situation that is not real. We are thinking about a possibility. We think if an action is done, the expected or desired result will not happen or we use this to emphasize that something would happen regardless if another thing happened or not.\n\nEven if he studies hard, he will fail the test because it is too hard for him.\n(=If he studies hard, he will still fail the test because it is too hard for him.)\n \n\nEven if she helped us, we would have failed.\n(Really, we failed.

(Present Tense)\nEven if she didn`t come to your birthday, she could have called to wish you a happy birthday. (Past tense)\nEven if it will be rainy, I will go. (Future Tense)\nEven if you haven`t seen the first movie, you can understand second. (Present Perfect)\nJust like in the present perfect example above, it is very common to mix tenses. One part of the sentence can be in a different tense than the other part.\n\nEven if he changes his job, he will still be unhappy.\nEven if I had money, I would still live here.\nEven if we don`t have a lot of time, we will do our best to come.\n2. We can use real conditionals and unreal conditionals after “even if”. Remember that real conditionals use present tense verbs and unreal conditionals use past tense or past perfect tense verbs.\n\nI would love you even if you were a monster! (Unreal Conditional)\nEven if she had helped us, we would have failed. (Unreal Conditional)\nEven if you don`t come, I will still like you.

We use “seem” when there is a reason or evidence for why we think something.\n\nFor example, if I meet a woman for the first time.

        "dialog": "This expression is used to express anger or surprise at someone`s action.\n\nIf somebody does something that is horrible or shocking, then we can use this question pattern to express anger or disbelief.\n\nThis question is usually a rhetorical question. It is not necessary to actually answer this question and the speaker is usually not asking for an answer.\n\nHow could you + verb…?\n\nRemember that “could” is the past tense form of “can”. So, this question is always referring to some action in the past.\n\nHow could you eat the whole box of cookies?\nHow could you lie to me?\nHow could you be so mean to her?\nHow could you forget my birthday?\nHow could you say that?\nHow could you not like that movie?\nHow could you betray us?\nHow could you deal with that?\nIf we are surprised or angry at a 3rd person`s action then we can change “you” to another person or organization.\n\nHow could he leave without saying goodbye?\nHow could Mark say those mean words to Alice?\nHow could they treat people so badly?\nHow could he be so greedy?\nHow could the company fire him?\nHow could the government do that?\nThere are many times when we use this expression to show surprise.

We often use the short form of this question when responding to what somebody said. When we use it this way, it is usually used to show anger and surprise.\n\nA) I`m sorry, but I forgot to feed your fish while you were on vacation and they died.\nB) How could you?\n\nA) She stole her cousin`s boyfriend.\nB) How could she?\n\nThis is also often used in a sarcastic way. In other words, we are speaking like we are angry, but we are not actually angry. We are just joking.\n\nA) I forgot to bring your book today.\nB) How could you? I`m just joking. Don`t worry about it. Just bring it tomorrow.\n\n2. We can make a very similar sentence using the present perfect tense.\n\nHow could he have finished all of his work already?\nHow could they have known that?\nHow could she have not been prepared for her presentation?\nHow could he have done that?\nHow could he have killed five innocent people?\nReal-World English Conversations\n\nA) How could you eat that whole pizza by yourself?\nB) I`m sorry. Did you want some?\n\nA) My boss called me an idiot today.\nB) How could he do that? He doesn`t sound like a good boss.\n\nA) How could they give their dog away?

I guess that makes sense.\n\nA) Mrs. Yellen was arrested last week.\nB) Why?\nA) She was stealing a lot of money from the organization she worked for.\nB) Didn`t she work for a charity that helps poor children?\nA) Yes.\nB) Oh my gosh!

        "dialog": "This sentence pattern is used to show that we will do something if we need to, if it is required, or if we have no problem doing it. It does not mean that we want to do something. It shows that we will do it if we need to.\n\nI am willing to work weekends or holidays.\n(This doesn`t mean that I want to work on weekends or holidays, but it means that I will work on these days if it is required or if I need to.)\nI would prefer to stay in New York City, but if the company needs me to work somewhere else, then I am willing to move.\n(My first choice is not to move, but I will do it if the company needs me to.)\nSubject + be verb + willing + infinitive…\n\nI am willing to help you.\nShe is willing to donate money to our charity.\nI am willing to move abroad for work.\nThey are willing to accept your offer.\nHe was willing to answer our questions.\n“Not willing” is very similar to “do not want”.\n\nHe is not willing to move abroad.\nShe`s not willing to transfer to a branch office.\nThey aren`t willing to negotiate.\nMark isn`t willing to compromise.\nMy children are often not willing to eat their vegetables.\nIt is very common to use an if-statement with these sentences.

Do not use “willing” when asking questions about things that people usually like or want.\n\nAre you willing to get a present? (Strange Question!)\nAre you willing to get a higher salary? (Strange Question!)\nThese are strange questions because everybody wants to get a present or has no problem getting a higher salary.\n\n2. These questions are often used during job interviews. Here are some examples of questions.\n\nWe often use “would” with these questions as part of an unreal conditional, but the “if-statement” has been removed.\n\nAre you willing to travel on business?\nAre you willing to move to a different city?\nAre you willing to work overtime?\nAre you willing to work on holidays if there is an emergency?\nWould you be willing to work late to help your coworkers (if you were hired)?\nWould you be willing to transfer to a branch office (if you worked here)?\nWould you be willing to start next week (if you got the job)?\nReal-World English Conversations\n\nA) Would you be willing to work weekends?\nB) I prefer to spend time with my family on the weekend, but if there is an emergency or important work, then I would be willing to work on the weekend.\n\nA) Would you be willing to give up one month`s salary in exchange for one month`s vacation?\nB) Haha.
