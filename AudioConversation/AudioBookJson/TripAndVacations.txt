We had already unpacked. So, we had to re-pack everything and ask for another room.\"\nTHOMAS: \"What was wrong with the second room?\"\nSAM: \"We paid for a garden room and it was a view of the parking lot.\"\nTHOMAS: \"That's terrible. Did you finally get a good room?\"\nSAM: \"They were out of garden view rooms, so they upgraded us to an ocean view room.\"\nTHOMAS: \"That's nice! So, why was it so awful?\"\nSAM: \"Our next door neighbor snored so loudly. He kept us awake every night.\"\nTHOMAS: \"Did you ask for another room?\"\nSAM: \"Yes, but they said that there were no more rooms available.\"\nTHOMAS: \"I'm sorry you had a terrible time.\"\nSAM: \"That's ok. The manager was really nice about it. He offered us a free stay next time.\"\nTHOMAS: \"Are you going to go back there?\"\nSAM: \"Of course. It'll be free.\"",
