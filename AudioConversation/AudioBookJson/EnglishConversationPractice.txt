It is a far cry from my last job.\n\nSuzy: What do you mean?\n\nTony: At my last company, there were many rules and regulations that employees had to follow. The company was not very flexible when it came to workers taking time off or leaving work early.\n\nSuzy: But your new company is better?\n\nTony: Much better. All the employees seem happy and satisfied with their jobs. I’m glad that I made the change. Right before I started this new job I was starting to have second thoughts. I almost changed my mind a few times.\n\nSuzy: Well, it’s a good thing that you didn’t.\n\nTony: You can say that again.",

I met him a couple weeks ago and he seemed like the same nice guy that he has always been. He didn’t brag or boast about his career at all.\n\nRyan: That’s exactly what I am saying. Even though he is successful, he doesn’t act like he is better than anyone. That’s why everybody likes him.\n\nErin: You’re right about that. Plus, he is an amazing musician.",

What are the two of you going to do?\n\nStacey: We are going to go downtown and do some shopping. After that, we will go out for a nice dinner. I made a reservation at a new French restaurant near the park. I can’t remember the name of it.\n\nErin: I know what restaurant you are talking about. I heard it is really good. I am jealous that you are going there. I can’t wait until I get a chance to try it.\n\nStacey: I will let you know how it is on Monday.\n\nErin: Sounds good.

Why on earth would you do that?\n\nTrisha: They are cute, and I want to get a pet because I get lonely at home sometimes.\n\nKyle: But monkeys are very hard to take care of, cost a lot of money, and can be dangerous. Why don’t you just get a cat?\n\nTrisha: Cats are not as fun as monkeys.\n\nKyle: But what are you going to do with the monkey when you travel or stay out late?\n\nTrisha: Actually, I hadn’t thought about that.\n\nKyle: Well, please think about it more before you make any rash decision. I promise that you will regret buying a monkey.",

I know a lot about the topic, but I still need to collect and organize a lot of data. On top of that, I need to explain the data and make conclusions about it.\n\nKlay: Wow! You got a lot of work to do. You should start right away. I will go down to the coffee shop and get you a big coffee and a sandwich.\n\nMegan: Thanks a lot. That would be great.",

We launched it over three weeks ago, and our sales numbers have been awful so far.\n\nPete: Are we going to stop production of the product?\n\nSuzy: I think it is a little early for that. Stopping production is our last resort. We will try some other things first before we even think about doing that.\n\nPete: I see. Why do you think the product hasn’t been selling well?\n\nSuzy: I’m not really sure. Some people think it is because we haven’t done a good job of marketing the product, but other people think it is because the product is poorly made and it is getting bad reviews.\n\nPete: I hope it’s the former. It would be a lot easier to adjust our marketing strategy than fixing or redesigning the product.\n\nSuzy: I couldn’t agree more.",
