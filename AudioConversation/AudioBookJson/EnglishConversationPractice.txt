It is a far cry from my last job.\n\nSuzy: What do you mean?\n\nTony: At my last company, there were many rules and regulations that employees had to follow. The company was not very flexible when it came to workers taking time off or leaving work early.\n\nSuzy: But your new company is better?\n\nTony: Much better. All the employees seem happy and satisfied with their jobs. I’m glad that I made the change. Right before I started this new job I was starting to have second thoughts. I almost changed my mind a few times.\n\nSuzy: Well, it’s a good thing that you didn’t.\n\nTony: You can say that again.",

What does it include?\n\nAmy: The set includes a large flat screen TV, surround sound speakers, and a bunch of other things. What are you going to do with your bonus?\n\nStephen: Well, originally, I was going to save my money, but after listening to you, I think that I am going to splurge on something for myself. I think I might get a couple of new pairs of sneakers.\n\nAmy: Sneakers?\n\nStephen: Yes. I like to collect sneakers.\n\nAmy: I didn’t know that.\n\nStephen: I guess that is due to the fact that you only see me at work. And at work, I only wear dress shoes.",

Also, during this afternoon’s meeting, he kept talking about how smart and great Jim is.\r\n\r\nMegan: Do you think Jim realizes what Kevin is doing?\r\n\r\nAngela: I think Jim knows that Kevin is sucking up to him, but I think that Jim likes it. He likes having someone always say nice things to him even if they are not completely true.\r\n\r\nMegan: I guess you’re right, but it is annoying to everyone else.\r\n\r\nAngela: You can say that again.",

But on the other hand, she doesn’t sugarcoat anything, so I always get direct feedback from her. Her direct feedback is sometimes tough to hear, but it helps me do my job better and helps me improve.\n\nRyan: What do you mean by ‘sugarcoat’?\n\nTrisha: If a person sugarcoats something, they make something bad or negative sound better than it is. It’s like putting sugar on top of disgusting food to make it taste better. It is the same thing as that but with words.\n\nRyan: I think I get it. It is basically exaggerating the positives of something to make a person feel better.\n\nTrisha: That’s right.",

I also showed her some recent studies that show that dogs reduce stress in children and make them happier.\n\nStacey: That was a smart approach. I wish I could get a dog.\n\nPete: Why don’t you? You could talk your husband into it if you tried.\n\nStacey: That’s impossible. My husband is allergic to dogs.
