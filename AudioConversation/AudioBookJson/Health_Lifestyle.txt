        "dialog": "Can you spread the new coronavirus if you do not feel sick? Do you need to wear a nose and mouth cover, or mask, to stop the spread of COVID-19?\r\n\r\nHealth experts have debated these issues since late December, when spread of a new coronavirus was first reported.\r\n\r\nFor months, the World Health Organization, or WHO, advised people not to wear masks. Other health organizations and governments, however, advised the opposite.\r\n\r\nLast week, the WHO changed its mask advice for the general public. The health agency said that people should wear cloth masks in public situations under some conditions. For example, masks are advised when a person cannot stay a safe distance from other people. The WHO said people over the age of 60 should also wear masks in public. And the organization advised people with health conditions, like diabetes and heart disease, to wear masks.\r\n\r\nPart of the reasoning, the experts said, was to prevent spread by people who have the virus but are asymptomatic. That means they do not show signs of disease.\r\n\r\nHowever, at a recent press conference, a COVID-19, WHO expert questioned this kind of spread. Maria Van Kerkhove told the group that data suggests spread by asymptomatic individuals is “very rare.”\r\n\r\nThat characterization of asymptomatic spread was criticized widely by doctors and other experts. On Tuesday, she spoke again, describing asymptomatic spread as a “really complex question.”\r\n\r\n“We don’t actually have that answer yet,” she said.\r\n\r\nVan Kerkhove said in her earlier comments she was speaking about several small studies of asymptomatic spread. She noted that there are some estimates that 40 percent of worldwide spread is the result of asymptomatic passage. “But,” she said, “those are from models, so I didn’t include that in my answer yesterday…”\r\n\r\nStill, many other scientists were shocked by the description of asymptomatic spread as “rare.” They say there is much evidence that people can spread the disease before showing signs of sickness.\r\n\r\nIvo Vlaev is professor of behavioral science at the University of Warwick in Britain. He said the release of conflicting information about the disease is a problem.\r\n\r\n“If you are giving them confusing messages or they’re not convinced about why they should do something, like wear masks, they will just ignore you,” he said.\r\n\r\nToday, there are more than seven million confirmed cases of COVID-19. Here are answers to some questions about the latest COVID-19 guidelines.\r\n\r\nCan people who do not feel sick spread COVID-19?\r\n\r\nIt appears so.\r\n\r\nThe WHO has said for months that the majority of COVID-19 spread is from people with disease signs, like a fever or cough. Agency officials also said that viral spread by people who do not feel sick was not considered a major driver of the disease.\r\n\r\nBut, the WHO’s emergencies chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, clarified this week that both “symptomatic and asymptomatic” people can spread the disease.\r\n\r\nDoes wearing a mask help?\r\n\r\nProbably.\r\n\r\nWearing a mask might not completely protect you from the virus as it can enter the body through the eyes. However, health experts believe mask use helps prevent wearers from spreading the virus if they are infected.\r\n\r\nWhile most spread is thought to happen by coughing and sneezing, Ryan said there is some suggestion that even singing or shouting could spread the virus.\r\n\r\nWhy are we still not sure?\r\n\r\nThe virus was first documented in December. The disease is still new to science.\r\n\r\nSome scientists say how the WHO identifies asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases is part of the problem.\r\n\r\nWhile truly asymptomatic people are likely not responsible for much virus spread, several studies show that pre-symptomatic people spread the disease. Some experts argue that recognizing and stopping this kind of spread is critical to controlling the crisis.\r\n\r\nMore research is needed. Few detailed studies and tests have been done of asymptomatic people and their possible link to disease spread. Some limited studies have suggested people can spread the virus before they show symptoms. The WHO has largely dismissed that research, however.\r\n\r\nBabak Javid is an infectious diseases doctor at Britain’s Cambridge University Hospital. He said the WHO should publish its information to show why passage of the disease in people without symptoms is “rare.”\r\n\r\nI’m Caty Weaver.\r\n\r\nHai Do adpated this story for Learning English based on Associated Press news reports.

        "dialog": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Health & Lifestyle report.\r\n\r\nThe number of births in the United States continued to fall last year. This led to the fewest U.S. newborns in 35 years, the Associated Press notes.\r\n\r\nThe number of newborns has been falling for more than 10 years. And some experts say the coronavirus pandemic and its effect on the economy will result in even fewer births.\r\n\r\n“This unpredictable environment, and concerns about the future, are going to make women think twice before having children,” said Denise Jamieson. She is a doctor and head of the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the latest birth numbers on May 20. The report is based on a study of more than 99% of birth records from 2019. The findings are considered preliminary.\r\n\r\nThe CDC found the number of births fell to about 3.7 million last year. This is about one percent less than the number in 2018.\r\n\r\nBirth rates continued to fall for teenagers and women in their 20s. However, for women in their early 40s, the report noted an increase in births.\r\n\r\nExperts say there are many reasons for falling birth rates. Among them are changing ideas about motherhood and family planning. Many women and couples now delay having children. Also, once they decide to start a family, they have fewer children.\r\n\r\nExperts also say there is good reason to think a weak economy will result in even lower birth rates. Aside from a one-year increase in 2014, U.S. births have been falling every year since 2007. That year a recession hit the United States. The drop in births continued even after the economy recovered.\r\n\r\nJohn Santelli is a professor of population and family health at Columbia University in New York. He says there are many reasons why economic conditions affect birth rates.\r\n\r\nSantelli noted that many jobs are low-paying and unpredictable. When you combine those kinds of jobs with the high cost of housing and other living expenses, people think carefully before having children.\r\n\r\nBrady Hamilton was the lead author of the CDC report. The effect of the pandemic, Hamilton said, will not become clear in hospital maternity wards until late this year or early next year.\r\n\r\nSantelli notes it is possible births will increase among some groups. Getting access to birth control and operations for ending pregnancies has become more difficult, he said. He added that couples stuck at home together may have more time for sex.\r\n\r\nHowever, other experts say it is more likely that birth rates will fall. Hans-Peter Kohler is a fertility researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. He said the idea that there will be a lot of “coronababies” is “widely perceived as a myth.”\r\n\r\nKohler said that the debate most experts are having is not about whether there will be a decrease in births, but whether it will be lasting.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s the Health & Lifestyle report.

        "dialog": "Doctors are reporting success with newer drugs that control some kinds of cancer better than current medicines. They say these drugs reduce the risk that the cancer will come back and make treatment simpler and easier for patients.\r\n\r\nOne such drug, taken as a daily pill, called Tagrisso, comes from drug manufacturer AstraZeneca. The British-based company says Tagrisso targets a mutation in the patient’s genes, unlike chemotherapy drugs, which can kill both cancerous and healthy cells.\r\n\r\nDoctors say the new drug’s side effects can be controlled long enough that it can be used for several years to help prevent the cancer from returning.\r\n\r\nYet Tagrisso and other newer drugs can cost $150,000 or more a year. How much patients end up paying depends on their healthcare insurance, earnings, and other considerations.\r\n\r\nLung cancer\r\n\r\nLung cancer kills more than 1.7 million people worldwide each year. Roy Herbst is a doctor with the Yale Cancer Center in the United States. He led a study of Tagrisso in 682 patients with the most common form of the disease. All had operable tumors with a mutation in a gene called EGFR. This unusual genetic structure is found in 10 percent to 35 percent of such cases, mainly among Asians and non-smokers.\r\n\r\nAbout half of the patients were given chemotherapy after their tumor operation. The drug treatment uses powerful chemicals to kill the cancer cells. The patients then took Tagrisso or harmless pills called placebos.\r\n\r\nIndependent observers stopped the study in April when the effectiveness of Tagrisso seemed clear.\r\n\r\nAfter two years on average, 89 percent of patients taking the drug were alive without cancer returning, compared to 53 percent of those on the placebo. Severe side effects were a little more common on Tagrisso. They included patients feeling tired and reddish skin in the mouth or around the nails.\r\n\r\nU.S. health officials have approved Tagrisso for use in treating advanced lung cancer, and “the excitement now is moving this earlier” before the disease has widely spread, noted Herbst.\r\n\r\nThe drug costs about $15,000 a month.\r\n\r\nProstate cancer\r\n\r\nMen with advanced prostate cancer often are treated with medicines to block male hormones that can help the cancer grow. The drugs are injected as shots in the arm every few months but take days or weeks to start working. They can also cause bone pain and other problems.\r\n\r\nAn experimental drug called relugolix is a different kind of hormone blocker and the first meant for use as a daily pill. The drug is a product of Myovant Sciences. Researchers tested it against shots of the drug leuprolide, an injectable man-made hormone, every three months in 930 men. They were treated for nearly a year.\r\n\r\nThe company reports that about 97 percent on the experimental drug kept hormones blocked throughout that time, compared to 89 percent on leuprolide. Four days after the start of treatment, 56% of men on relugolix and none on leuprolide had hormones blocked.\r\n\r\nThree percent of the men taking relugolix experienced a serious heart problem, such as a heart attack or stroke. That compares to six percent of the men on leuprolide. The difference was even greater among men who suffered heart problems earlier.\r\n\r\nMyovant is seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the drug.\r\n\r\nColon cancer\r\n\r\nMerck & Company manufactures Keytruda, an experimental drug, that helps the body’s natural defense system find and fight cancer. Keytruda proved better than traditional chemotherapy treatments for people with advanced colon cancer and tumors with gene defects that result in a high number of mutations.\r\n\r\nThe study involved 307 patients in France. Those given Keytruda went more than 16 months on average before their cancer worsened. That compares with 8 months for those taking chemotherapy treatments. After a year, 55 percent on Keytruda were alive without worsening cancer compared to 37 percent on chemotherapy. After two years, the rate was 48 percent versus nearly 19 percent.\r\n\r\nAbout 22% of people getting Keytruda had severe side effects compared to 66% on chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nThe Associated Press adds that Keytruda costs about $12,500 a month.\r\n\r\nI’m Jonathan Evans.",

        "dialog": "Over the past week, people across the United States have been protesting the death of George Floyd.\n\nThe 46-year-old black man died while being held by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Videos of Floyd’s death show a white police officer keeping a knee pressed on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd can be heard repeatedly saying, “I can’t breathe.”\n\nThe protests -- and police actions to control them -- are threatening to undo American health officials’ efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19.\n\nHealth experts need newly infected people to remember everyone they were in contact with in the days leading up to their confirmed sickness. This helps to let others know they may have been exposed -- and prevent those people from spreading the disease even more.\n\nThe process is known as contact tracing. It depends on people being able to know who they came close to. That is no easy task if someone has attended a protest with hundreds or even thousands of other people.\n\nThe process also depends on something that may be in especially short supply right now: Trust in government.\n\n“These events that are happening now are further threats to the trust we need,” said Dr. Sandro Galea. He leads Boston University’s School of Public Health.\n\nGovernment officials hope to continue reopening businesses, religious centers and other organizations after months of stay-at-home orders and other infection-prevention measures. But health experts also hoped that reopening would include widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation to prevent new waves of illness from beginning.\n\nIt is unclear if the protests will lead to new outbreaks. The protests have taken place outside, where the virus does not spread as easily. Also, many of the protesters have been seen wearing face masks.\n\nBut experts still worry that public efforts to contain the disease in the future could be harmed.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the city’s mayor announced Saturday that COVID-19 testing centers were being closed because of safety concerns related to violent protests. And some medical centers in Minneapolis that provide testing have been damaged in the protests, a government spokesperson said.\n\nReduced testing could “be giving the virus another head start,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.\n\n\nConcern over contact tracing\n\nContact tracing, which is only just getting started in several states, is an even bigger concern. It involves people who work for or with health departments asking questions about where a person has been and who they have been talking to — and getting full, truthful answers in return.\n\nSchaffner said the current situation in the U.S. could make people less likely to speak with anyone working for the government.\n\nThat is especially true in black communities dealing with police violence and long-held frustrations with how they are mistreated by people who work for government agencies. Those are also the communities that have been hit hardest by the coronavirus and are most in need of public health measures to help control the spread.\n\nIn a press conference last week, Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington used the term “contact tracing” when describing an investigation into protesters who had been arrested in the state. He said the goal was to “see if there are any crime or white supremacy organizations” that caused violence and destruction and “to understand how...we go after them, legally.”\n\nHarrington’s use of “contact tracing” by law enforcement may make the job of health workers more difficult, some experts said.\n\n“That was an abuse of the word ‘contact tracing.’ That is not what contact tracing is,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“Contact tracing is a service to patients and their contacts to provide services for patients and warning for contacts, Frieden said. \"It has nothing to do with police activity. Nothing.”\n\nBoston University’s Galea said he hopes many people will separate in their minds the contact tracing done by public health workers from crime investigations by the police. But, he added, “I do think sometimes it’s difficult to make a distinction when you feel...targeted by the entire government.”\n\nI’m Ashley Thompson.",

        "dialog": "The coronavirus is killing thousands and commanding government attention across Latin America. But another deadly viral infection remains a problem for the region: dengue.\n\nDengue, which is spread by mosquitoes, has been called “breakbone fever” for the severe physical pain it causes.\n\nDoctors and health officials are concerned about the effect of COVID-19, the breathing disorder caused by the virus, on Latin American countries. They say COVID-19’s arrival has pulled attention and resources away from the fight against dengue.\n\nThe Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) expects 2020 to be marked by high rates of dengue across the region.\n\nAround the world, COVID-19 has affected other diseases in different ways. In Europe, measures to stop the coronavirus have banished seasonal influenza. But in Africa, border closures have stopped transportation of measles vaccines and other supplies.\n\nIn Latin America, a dengue epidemic that started in late 2018 is still present. Dengue infections in the region rose sharply to an all-time high of 3.1 million in 2019, with over 1,500 deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean. That information comes from PAHO.\n\nCases of the disease should begin to decrease in the second half of 2020, the organization said.\n\nDengue epidemics usually happen every three to five years and with four strains of dengue in existence, people may catch it more than once. Second cases are more likely to be severe.\n\n“COVID is the star right now, so all of the attention is being put on COVID,” said Jaime Gomez. “But there are still problems with dengue.” He is a doctor and works at a hospital in Floridablanca, in Colombia’s Santander province.\n\nDengue is not usually deadly and can be treated with painkillers. But some sufferers deal with long-term problems like tiredness, weight loss, and depression. And these things affect their ability to work. Severe dengue is treated with intravenous fluids and those who do not get tested are at risk of dangerous health problems.\n\nSuch treatments cannot be given if patients stay home, worried about getting the coronavirus, or if crowded hospitals cannot take dengue patients.\n\nThere are not many cases of COVID-19 in the part of Colombia where Gomez works. He told Reuters news agency he had seen hospitalizations decrease by half, as people were fearful of going outdoors.\n\n‘System has collapsed’\n\nSonia Fernandez is a lawyer from Paraguay. She avoided seeking medical care when she and her two daughters, ages 11 and 8, got sick with dengue at the beginning of April. Fernandez wanted to avoid individuals with COVID-19, she said.\n\nAll three have since recovered.\n\nDengue cases in Paraguay have sharply risen this year. In the first 18 weeks of 2020, the country reported more than 40,000 confirmed cases and more than 60 deaths. That is compared to under 400 confirmed cases and six deaths during the same period in 2019.\n\nIn Ecuador, the coronavirus outbreak has hit hard. Hospitals in Guayaquil, the largest city, are full. The number of dengue cases has dropped nationwide, but this could cover up other issues.\n\nEcuador’s health ministry notes that dengue cases were highest at close to 900 in the week ending March 14. That is two weeks after the country confirmed its first case of COVID-19. For the week of April 4, they fell to around 250.\n\nEsteban Ortiz is an international health researcher at the University of the Americas in Quito.\n\nHe says dengue cases are being under-reported.\n\n“Cases haven’t decreased, the diagnosis of cases has decreased, which confirms the system has totally collapsed,” he said.\n\n\n\nEcuador’s health ministry said that the country was no more exposed to the double effects of COVID-19 and dengue than any other Latin American country. It added it has the supplies it needs to treat cases of dengue.\n\nDengue has also increased sharply in Central America. In Costa Rica, cases have risen nearly 200 percent through May 1, compared with a year ago, to over 2,000.\n\nRodrigo Marin is director of Costa Rica’s health surveillance agency. He told Reuters that while his country is having a difficult time dealing with COVID-19, other diseases continue to spread.\n\nIn Panama, dengue has caused at least two deaths this year. Speaking with Reuters, Panama City health official Yamileth Lopez said that “Dengue kills too.”\n\nI’m Alice Bryant.",

        "dialog": "American drug maker Moderna said Monday that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced antibodies in a small group of healthy people in an early trial.\n\nThe company said eight people who received two small amounts of its vaccine developed antibodies similar to those developed by people who have recovered from the disease.\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases led the experiment, also called a trial. It involved 45 volunteers who received one or two shots of differing amounts of the vaccine.\n\nTal Zaks is the chief medical officer at Moderna. Based on early results of the trial, he said the vaccine “has the potential to prevent COVID-19 disease….” He also said the company now can better choose the vaccine amount needed for further experiments.\n\nThe testing involved three different amounts. Zaks said the two smaller amounts of vaccine seem safe and the larger amount caused some short-term side effects. Three study subjects developed “flu-like” conditions following a second shot of the large dose. Moderna said it plans to drop that amount for the next part of the trial.\n\nAmesh Adalja is an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who was not involved in the study. He told Reuters that the findings are meaningful, but noted that they come from only eight people. “It was designed for safety. Not for efficacy,” he said.\n\n\nModerna has been permitted to start a second part of human testing that will involve several hundreds of people. In April, the U.S. government gave the company $483 million for vaccine development. Last week, U.S. officials gave the vaccine special recognition to help speed the process for approval.\n\nStéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna, said the company is hoping to start part three of the study in July. The company will try to find the lowest amount of vaccine necessary to protect people.\n\nIn May, Moderna and the biotechnology company Lonza agreed to work together over the next ten years to make a vaccine. The partnership could lead to the manufacture of 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine treatments a year.\n\nThere are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19. Almost 4.8 million people are confirmed to have had the virus. It is known to have killed about 320,000. However, experts think the numbers may be underreported.\n\nThe World Health Organization has listed more than 100 efforts to develop effective treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus. The list includes clinical trials in China, at the University of Oxford, and with American drug makers Pfizer, Inovio and Moderna.\n\nExperts predict a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop. The results of Moderna’s early trial have not been published. But the news lifted the company’s stock prices and spread hope that a solution against the infectious disease might be close.\n\nI`m Jonathan Evans.",

        "dialog": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Health & Lifestyle report.\n\nThe world is experiencing a major health crisis.\n\nAs the new coronavirus spreads, many countries are limiting their citizens’ activities. Travel has been restricted. Many schools are closed. In major cities around the world, restaurants and other businesses are shut down.\n\nPublic emergencies bring out a certain type of person – the panic shopper. Some people fear not being able to find basic needs for survival. So, they buy everything off supermarket shelves in preparation for the days to come.\n\nBread is often among the first products to disappear in emergency situations.\n\n\nSo, if you have never made bread, now may be good time to learn. Bread making is a survival skill. With very few simple things -- such as flour, salt and yeast -- you can bake a fresh loaf of bread for your family, neighbors or coworkers.\n\nBaking is not just a useful survival skill. It can make you feel better at stressful times. In fact, baking and cooking have been used to treat people with mental health issues.\n\nJulie Ohana is a social worker. She offers what she calls culinary therapy to her patients in New York City.\n\n“I say ‘therapy’ because to me cooking is so therapeutic. And ‘therapeutic’ really means something that makes you feel good, something that is helpful and beneficial to the person doing it ...”\n\nJulie Ohana uses culinary therapy to help people overcome many kinds of issues. She explains that culinary therapy works on many levels.\n\nBaking requires mindfulness.\n\n“So when you’re in the kitchen – whether you’re cooking or you’re baking – it really requires a certain level of mindfulness, of being present in the moment. Specifically, when you’re baking. And baking really requires step-by-step, following a recipe, being more precise. Kneading the dough or rolling something out, you really get the full benefit of being present in the moment and being able to relax and put aside all the other thoughts and just focus on the here-and-now. And there really are very strong benefits of being able to do that, to be able to relax, to decompress, destress, and really increase one’s level of life satisfaction.”\n\nBaking is a labor of love.\n\nOhana also says baking is a process filled with love. It not only makes you feel good, it produces something tangible -- something you can touch and eat! Ohana calls baking a labor of love.\n\n“And when you bake, you go through this whole process and it really is a labor of love … and you end up with this finished product that - not only is it tangible - but it’s edible and it’s delicious.”\n\nBaking is emotional.\n\nOften our food experiences are tied to family memories and stories. We remember meals our grandmothers made. We teach our children important recipes for family favorites.\n\nOhana says something that all bakers know -- giving delicious, baked goods makes the giver feel as good as the receiver. So, she calls baking a win-win.\n\n“To be able to pass that on to someone else certainly can make the day for the person receiving it. But It’s also just as powerful for the person who’s giving the baked goods. It’s a win-win. It’s not just something purely that you do for the other person. The baker, the cook really gets to benefit from the act as well.”\n\nAnd that’s the Health & Lifestyle report. I’m Anna Matteo.",

        "dialog": "It took Viktery Zimmerman only two days to find ways to connect with friends and family. She and her husband are stuck inside their home in Chicago, Illinois, as ordered by the state’s stay-at-home measure.\n\nThere are the FaceTime video calls. There is the movie night with friends who are also stuck at home. There are plans for a game night. Viktery will do whatever is necessary to keep her from, as she puts it, “spinning in circles.”\n\nShe describes herself as an extrovert -- someone who likes being with and talking to other people. Her husband, Justin Zimmerman, is an introvert. In other words, he is quieter and needs more alone time than his wife.\n\nHe laughs at their differences in personalities. “Now it’s become a thing where people are FaceTiming us all day, every day to say ‘Hi,’” he said. “I’m like, ‘You really don’t have to.’”\n\nMost Americans and many other people around the world are following stay-at-home orders designed to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. The crisis has led to many changes — including how and when people have social exchanges.\n\nThe changes to daily life have affected extroverts and introverts in different ways. They may come as a release of pressure for some introverts who no longer must explain why they do not want to take part in social activities. Extroverts, however, are left seeking out social connection in a world where that is suddenly limited.\n\nEric Bellmore considers himself an extrovert. He found himself shouting a hello to someone he did not know when he went for a run near his home in the state of Michigan. He just wanted a chance to speak with someone.\n\nBellmore said, “It’s mind-boggling to grasp how much I need to be around other folk.”\n\nBut, social distancing has been a more pleasant change for David Choi, a Los Angeles musician who describes himself as introverted. His profession often requires him to be networking – attending social events and meeting new people in the hopes of getting professional help.\n\nThe order restricting movement, he says, “gives you an excuse to stay home, which is what you want to do in the first place.”\n\nThe world generally has been a place where extroverts are rewarded and introverts are judged, says Lisa Kaenzig. She is a top administrator at William Smith College in New York and very much an extrovert. But she has studied introverted learners for years.\n\nKaenzig says everyone might share in the fear and worry over the virus. But she says most of the introverts she has spoken to report that the limited social activity has been good for them.\n\n“All of the things that make the world harder for them as introverts, the world is better for them right now. They’re adapting much more quickly,” she says.\n\nSome introverts, however, may struggle with the idea that staying home is an issue of government demand. It is no longer possible to visit a restaurant or coffee place when they do want to connect with people.\n\nJackie Aina of Buffalo, New York, would often do just that when she was working from home.\n\n“Now that control is being taken away,” she says. “That’s very different than choosing when and how you get to stay at home.”\n\nI`m Ashley Thompson.",

        "dialog": "New parents who clean their homes very often to protect their babies from bacteria and other organisms might want to cut back their efforts.\n\nA new study suggests that high levels of contact with cleaning products are linked to an increased risk of the childhood breathing condition known as asthma.\n\nResearchers asked a group of parents how often they used 26 common household cleaners during their babies’ first three to four months of life. By age three, the children who had come in contact with cleaning products the most were more likely to be diagnosed with asthma. The researchers said that children who had a lot of contact with cleaners were 37 percent more likely to have asthma than children with the least contact.\n\nThe study also found that a lot of exposure to cleaning products caused children to be 35 percent more likely to have chronic difficulty breathing. In addition, they were 49 percent more likely to have chronic allergies.\n\nTim Takaro, who helped lead the study, is a doctor with Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada. He told the Reuters news service he understands that parents want to make their homes safe for their children. But he suggests that they should question the belief that their home is clean only if it smells like chemical-based cleaning products.\n\n“Instead, we propose that the smell of a healthy home is no smell at all,” said Takaro.\n\nTakaro said parents should read labels and look for products that are free of substances like chemical colors and smells. Also, they should consider natural cleaning products instead of chemical ones.\n\nThe study appeared in the medical publication CMAJ earlier this month. The researchers wrote that the first months of life are very important for development of the body’s natural defenses, known as the immune system. The same is true for the organs involved in breathing.\n\nChemicals in cleaning products can cause chronic inflammation that may lead to asthma. It also may make symptoms appear more often and intensely, the researchers noted.\n\nAsthma can be difficult to diagnose with breathing tests involving young children. So researchers also tested the children’s skin for allergies and asked parents how often children experienced symptoms like trouble breathing.\n\nThe most commonly used cleaning products in the study were dishwashing soap, multipurpose cleaners, glass cleaners and soap for washing clothes.\n\nThe American Lung Association recommends avoiding cleaning products that contain volatile organic substances and other irritants. But companies in Canada and the United States are not required to list all the chemicals in cleaning products. Some products labeled as environmentally friendly, or “green,” may contain harmful substances.\n\nElissa Abrams, who wrote comments on the study, is a doctor with the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada. She admitted that the effects of cleaning products are not well understood. But she believes these products and the chemicals they contain act as irritants to growing children.\n\nYoung children who spend a lot of time indoors may be at greater risk, said Abrams.\n\n“The take-home message is that parents should be careful which cleaning products they use in the home,” she added.\n\nI’m Pete Musto.",

        "dialog": "“1-2-3,” shouts Noradhiah Tumirin, a medical doctor and fitness trainer. “You can do it,” she says approvingly as her client, Sarah Baharudin, lies on her back and struggles to lift her legs in the air.\n\nTumirin is leading Baharudin in an exercise class. Baharudin, age 35, is breathing heavily as she lifts her legs. She is 165 centimeters tall and weighs 110 kilograms. The Malaysian woman blames her diet for her weight gain.\n\n“I eat traditional Malay food, yes and it’s high in fat and calorie.”\n\nBaharudin added that, for years, she also was not physically active and did not exercise.\n\n“So yes, years after years of doing that and it becomes obesity.”\n\nHer story is a common one across Malaysia. About 50 percent of the country’s adults are obese and about 30 percent of young people are overweight.\n\nSarah Baharudin and husband, Nazrul Mohammad, are trying to change their lifestyles by exercising regularly and eating healthier food.\n\nNoradhiah Tumirin is now retired, but once served in the Malaysian armed forces. She is physically fit, measuring 157 centimeters tall and weighing just 56 kilograms. She says the country’s obesity crisis is leading to high rates of heart disease and related medical conditions.\n\n“This obesity will lead to multiple illnesses such as hypertension, high cholesterol, heart illnesses and diabetes.”\n\nKevin Zahri is one of Malaysia’s leading fitness influencers. He founded a local weight loss movement called Jom Kurus, which means “let’s get thin” or “let’s lose weight.”\n\n“To help somebody not feel alone and jump on the bandwagon with a group of people...of similar objectives, goals and desires.”\n\nEvery year, thousands of Malaysians join six-week-long Jom Kurus fitness camps. They meet several times a week for exercises and to learn more about nutrition. There also are social media support groups. At one recent class, people did leg lifts, pushups and stretches.\n\nKevin Zahri says the average person at the camp drops four to five kilos of weight during the six week program. But his real goal is to help Malaysians make healthy changes that will last a lifetime.\n\nThat is what Sarah Baharudin is pushing for by getting on a regular exercise routine and improving her diet.\n\n“I have decided to change my lifestyle into a healthier one.”\n\nBut while Jom Kurus and other programs are helping Malaysians change their lifestyles, it is clear these classes only treat a small part of the nation’s obesity crisis.\n\nZahri says the amount of people they have targeted is very small compared to the people who need more exercise and changes in diet.\n\nBaharudin knows that changing lifelong behaviors is not easy but she says she is strong-minded enough to make this the beginning of a new way of life.\n\nI`m Alice Bryant.",
