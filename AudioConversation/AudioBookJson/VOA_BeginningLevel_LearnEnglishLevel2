        "dialog": "Anna: Hum. Oh! “Important meeting. Everyone must come.” Well, back to work! And my boss has called a meeting. I wonder what it`s about. Maybe we`re all getting raises! Ooo, there`s Jonathan! Maybe he knows.\n\nProfessor Bot: Hi! I`m Professor Bot! This video is all about work. People talk about jobs and things that happen at work. Your assignment is to find as many work words as you can. Don`t worry, I`ll help.\n\nAnna: So, Jonathan, what do you think today`s meeting is about? The email sounded important.\n\nJonathan: Well, I have heard people in the building talking about budget cuts.\n\nAnna: Oh! Budget cuts? Wait, who has been talking about budget cuts?\n\nJonathan: Mark in Accounting.\n\nAnna: Mark in Accounting? That`s one person. That`s not “people.”\n\nJonathan: I know, but Mark knows everything that goes on at The Studio.\n\nAnna: That is true. But wait, look at us. We shouldn`t gossip. That`s how rumors start. We`ll just go to the meeting and see what happens.\n\nJonathan: You`re right. No more talk about budget cuts.\n\nAmelia: Budget cuts? Oh no!\n\nAmelia: I just heard Anna and Jonathan talking about budget cuts.\n\nKaveh: That must be what the meeting is about. When there are budget cuts, people lose their jobs.\n\nAmelia: Not you. You`re a good reporter.\n\nKaveh: And it`s not you. You`ve done a great job as a videographer.\n\nAmelia: I can`t go back to being a detective. Criminals scare me!\n\nKaveh: And I can`t go back to being a teacher! High school kids scare me!\n\nProfessor Bot: Did you hear any work words? They talked about a lot of jobs. You can make the name of a job by adding an ending to a verb! Kaveh reports, so, he`s a reporter. Amelia used to detect, so she was a detective. If you teach, you`re a teacher. And a videographer….uh, I think you understand. Back to the story.\n\nKaveh: Penelope, have you heard the news? Today`s meeting is about budget cuts.\n\nPenelope: That`s awful! What should I do?\n\nKaveh: Update your résumé. I’ve already updated mine. I’ll see you at the meeting.\n\nMs. Weaver: Hello everyone! Quiet, please. Quiet, please!\n\nMs. Weaver: This meeting won’t take long. Then you can all leave.\n\nMs. Weaver: What is wrong with everyone? You look like I`m going to fire you. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, what is wrong with everyone?\n\nAnna: Excuse me, Ms. Weaver?\n\nMs. Weaver: Yes, Anna.\n\nAnna: Well, everyone has been worrying about, you know … We’ve been worrying that you are going to fire us!\n\nMs. Weaver: I’m not going to fire any of you! No! The reason for this meeting is to tell you what a good job you’ve been doing and give out new assignments. Budget cuts have been happening. But only one person has lost their job -- Mark in Accounting? Now, let’s talk about those new assignments.\n\nProfessor Bot: Ms. Weaver`s team is doing a good job! How did you do?

Wish me luck.\n\nProfessor Bot: I wonder what Anna’s new assignment will be? Professor Bot here! While you are watching, look for phrasal, or two-word verbs. Some stay together, like “go back” and some can come apart, like “give [assignments] out.” Good luck, Anna!\n\nMs. Weaver: So, as I said at the meeting last week, I have new assignments for everyone at The Studio. Anna, you`re good at asking questions. So, I want you to go back to hosting and reporting.\n\nAnna: That sounds great.\n\nMs. Weaver: You`re also a team player. So, I want you team up with someone ...\n\nAnna: That sounds even better!\n\nMs. Weaver: ... someone who is very \"different\" from you.\n\nAnna: That sounds ... what do you mean \"different\"?\n\nMs. Weaver: Well, you are very cheerful, you`re a people person. I want you to team up with someone who ... isn`t.\n\nAnna: Ms. Weaver, I will find that person.\n\nMimi: Excuse me. Are you using this chair?\n\nPete: Yes.\n\nAnna: Pete, hi! Thanks for meeting me.\n\nPete: Sure. But I don’t have lots of time, Anna. I’m busy looking for work.\n\nAnna: Pete, you can tear these want ads up and throw them away! I have good news!\n\nPete: Anna, I was working on that crossword puzzle.\n\nAnna: Oh. Sorry. Sorry. Pete, forget about the crossword puzzle. I have a job offer for you!\n\nPete: I`m listening.\n\nAnna: My boss wants me to team up with someone to host a talk show. But the person must be different from me. So, I thought of you.\n\nPete: Different from you? What do you mean?\n\nAnna: I`m sorry, Pete, I don`t have time right now. Here`s my boss`s address. Your interview is tomorrow morning at 10 am.\n\nPete: But what do you mean “different”?\n\nAnna: Just be yourself, Pete. Just be yourself.\n\nProfessor Bot: Did you find any two-word verbs? Here’s one example. Pete can throw the wants ads away! Throw away is a two-word verb.\n\nMs. Weaver: Thanks for coming in, Pete.\n\nPete: Thanks for the opportunity, Ms. Weaver.\n\nMs. Weaver: I need to find out if you have the skills for this job. And I want you to be completely honest.\n\nPete: Okay.\n\nMs. Weaver: First, let`s talk about your personal skills. Pete, are you a people person?\n\nPete: Well, okay, sometimes I think people talk too much.\n\nMs. Weaver: Pete, what work of yours are you most proud of?\n\nPete: Last year, I locked myself in a cabin and wrote a book. I didn`t speak to anybody the entire time! It was the best two months of my life.\n\nMs. Weaver: Okay. I think I’ve heard enough.\n\nAnna: Hey! Hey, Pete, how was the interview with Ms. Weaver?\n\nPete: Well, she said I was grumpy and not good with people.\n\nAnna: And … ?\n\nPete: And, I got the job!\n\nAnna: I knew it! Congratulations!

        "dialog": "Anna: Today, Pete and I are meeting with a consultant who will help us with our new show. Yesterday, Pete had promised to meet me here at 8:00 am. but he did not come on time.\n\nProf Bot: Uh-oh. It’s bad to be late for a business meeting. But while we wait for Pete, let’s talk about a new verb tense -- past perfect! You know the past tense, right? Like, \"Pete promised to meet me here at 8:00 a.m.\" Past perfect is a little different. When we talk about two things in the past, we can use the past perfect for the first event. Put \"had\" before the past participle. \"Pete had promised he would meet Anna.\" Here`s your assignment: find sentences with the past perfect tense. Remember, look for \"had!\"\n\nKelly: You two are late -- exactly 43 minutes late! What happened?\n\nAnna: He had to get his \"special\" coffee -- SPECIAL coffee!\n\nPete: She had to feed her birds -- HER birds!\n\nKelly: Okay, I can see already that you need my help. You can’t both talk at the same time. You have to take turns. Alright, Anna, you go first.\n\nAnna: Sure. Kelly, see, Pete and I live in the same building. So, we decided to meet at 8:00 a.m. - 8:00 a.m. to come to work together. I had waited 15 minutes when Pete arrived!\n\nAnna: After Pete had wasted time waiting for coffee, we were late. I left you a message.*\n\nKelly: Hum. I didn’t get that message.\n\nAnna: Oh. Sorry.\n\nKelly: Pete?\n\nProf. Bot: Anna left a message. That’s the right thing to do. Did you find some examples of the past perfect sentences? I did. Anna said,\n\nAnna: \"After Pete had wasted time waiting for coffee, we were late.\n\nLook at that coffee! It looks more like dessert! Okay, keep watching for past perfect!\n\nPete: Yeah, that’s not why we’re late. This is why we’re late: I had arrived on time at 8:00 a.m. but didn’t see Anna. She was standing behind a tree. I think she was hugging it. I always walk to work. But she said that would take too long and that a scooter would be much faster. It was awful. I hated it. And it added too much time to our commute!\n\nThen Anna stopped by a pond to feed the birds. She had named them after characters from books and yelled the names out loud … Romeo! Juliet! Sherlock!\n\nBy the time she had fed all the birds, we were late.\n\nKelly: This is what I think. You two see the same event very differently. Does this happen often with you two?\n\nPete: Yes.\n\nAnna: No.\n\nPete: No.\n\nAnna: Yes.\n\nKelly: Okay. This is good. This is good! It’s good to see things differently. I have an idea: we will call the show \"He Said, She Said.\" For every story, you tell a different point of view.\n\nAnna: That is a great idea, Kelly! Pete, we are different. That’s why I thought of you for this job!\n\nKelly: I think you two understand perfectly.\n\nAnna: Let’s get to work!\n\nKelly: She named the birds? Really?\n\nPete: Yeah…\n\n* Business people in the U.S. think you should come to a meeting at the exact time. If you are late to a business appointment, you should call and explain why.\n\nNEW WORDS:\ncommute - v. to travel regularly to and from a place and especially between where you live and where you work\nconsultant - n. a person who gives professional advice or services to companies for a fee\nevent- n. something (especially something important or notable) that happens\nexactly - adv. used to stress that something is accurate, complete, or correct\nhug - v. to put your arms around someone especially as a way of showing love or friendship\npoint of view - n. a way of looking at or thinking about something\npond - n. an area of water that is surrounded by land and that is smaller than a lake\npromise - v. to tell someone that you will definitely do something or that something will definitely happen in the future\nscooter - n. a child`s vehicle that is made of a narrow board with two small wheels attached\nwaste - v. to use (something valuable) in a way that is not necessary or effective",

        "dialog": "Anna: Hello, I’m Anna …\n\nPete: … and I’m Pete. Welcome to “He Said,\n\nAnna: … She Said”!\n\nPete: Because there are always two sides …\n\nAnna: to every story!\n\nAnna: Today’s show is about Circus Arts!\n\nPete: Circus? That’s not an art form.\n\nAnna: Yes, it is.\n\nPete: No, it isn`t.\n\nAnna: Yes, it is.\n\nPete: No, it isn`t.\n\nAnna: Yes, it is!\n\nPete: No, it isn`t.\n\nAnna: Yes, it is!\n\nPete: No, it isn`t.\n\nAnna: Yes, it is!\n\nProfessor Bot: Oh dear. Anna and Pete do not agree about Circus Arts. But that`s okay. Today’s lesson is about agreeing and disagreeing. Let’s listen to how Anna and Pete disagree or agree. Let’s hope these two can agree on something.\n\nAnna: Today, let’s run away with the circus!\n\nRecently, I went to a circus festival. There was a huge circus tent. And many different circus performers. It was a celebration of circus arts!\n\nPete: That looks fun, Anna. But I don’t think circus performers are artists. I think they’re athletes with interesting skills … and costumes.\n\nAnna: Hmm, that is a very interesting point of view, Pete. And I completely disagree.\n\nPete: Anna, Michelangelo was an artist. Rembrandt was an artist. People who swing from ropes are not artists. I know it’s not easy to swing from a bar and catch someone by the hands. You have to be very athletic to do that.\n\nAnna: That’s a good point, Pete. They are athletic. But they are called trapeze artists. Trapeze … ARTISTS.\n\nPete: I hear what you’re saying, Anna. I do. But where is the art? Look at these guys. They’re jugglers.\n\nAnna: Yes, they are skilled in the art of juggling.\n\nPete: They have a special skill. But are they artists?\n\nAnna: Yes!\n\nPete: No!\n\nPete: They`re just throwing things back and forth.\n\nAnna: Kind of like you and me, Pete. We’re going back and forth on this issue.\n\nPete: I don’t think we’ll ever agree on this one.\n\nAnna: No, but we can agree that these young people are amazing.\n\nPete: Okay, yeah. We can agree on that. But, still, they are very athletic – flipping and throwing each other around.\n\nAnna: Yes, I agree with you on that point.\n\nProfessor. Bot: They did it! They agreed!! Anna says she agrees that the performers are athletic. \"That’s a good point, Pete. They are athletic. I agree with you on that point. \" Now look for other ways they agree.\n\nPete: Anna? Anna!!\n\nAnna: Sorry! Sorry! But he’s an artist too. He is telling a story with his sticks and his costume.\n\nPete: What story? What costume?\n\nAnna: I see your point, Pete. I really do. But circus performers do more than physical tricks. Look! Look at these amazing performers!\n\nPete: I will admit -- I like their costumes.\n\nAnna: You know, Pete. Let’s let the performers speak for themselves.\n\nAnna: Kate and Piper tell stories while hanging upside down on a ring!\n\nPete: Was it hard to interview them upside down?\n\nAnna: I interviewed them right side up, Pete. Kate says circus performing may be athletic but it’s not competitive. With most sports, you compete.\n\nKate: It’s an art form because like, other sports are competing. This is simply performing and having fun.\n\nPete: Okay, Kate made a really good point. In athletics, there is a lot of competition. But still …\n\nAnna: Here’s Piper, Pete. Please pay attention, Pete.\n\nPete: But, I -\n\nAnna: Shh.\n\nPiper: Well, when you’re up in the air doing circus you have to perform. And so, we learn to embody characters, and to move fluidly and gracefully … in artistic ways.\n\nAnna: And that …is why they are artists!\n\nPete: You’re right, Anna. Oh, you’re right. It’s just so beautiful.\n\nAnna: I know. I know, Pete.\n\nProfessor Bot: Good job you two! I`m so glad that Anna and Pete finally agree! Pete said, \" You’re right, Anna.\" I agree, too. Circus arts are beautiful.

        "dialog": "Anna: “Do you need a vacation?” Wow. That was the best vacation I have ever had … in my head. A beach is much better than here. I need a vacation!\n\nProfessor Bot: I hear you, Anna. I need a vacation too but not at the beach. Sand is not good for robots! When we compare things, we use special forms of adjectives. \"Better\" is a comparative adjective. That is used to compare two things. \"Best\" is a superlative adjective. It shows that one thing has more of ...something than ALL of the others. Try to find more of these adjectives. Look for ER or EST at the end.\n\nDan: NO! You can’t get your money back. I don’t care that it was your worst vacation ever!\n\nDan: Hello! Have a seat! Welcome to the World’s Best Vacation Travel Agency!\n\nAnna: Thank you and congratulations!\n\nDan: For what?\n\nAnna: For being the world’s best travel agency.\n\nDan: Right … thanks.\n\nDan: Trudy, hold my calls. I am going to sell our most expensive vacation.\n\nTrudy: Sure thing, Boss.\n\nDan: The Mountain Getaway is good for you. It’s a little pricey. But think of it -- you, on top of a mountain for seven days!\n\nAnna: I’m afraid of high places.\n\nDan: Of course you are. That’s why our Deep Sea Adventure is better for you! It is pricier than the Mountain Getaway. Just you and the animals of the sea!\n\nAnna: Shark! Shark!\n\nDan: No, there are no sharks in your dream vacation! You need the Safari Camp Out! It is our priciest vacation. But I think it’s the best one for you. During the day, you’ll see elephants, giraffes and lions. At night, you’ll sleep out under the stars.\n\nAnna: Look, I think this was a bad idea.\n\nDan: Sure, you can leave. But then you won’t see the latest vacation technology.\n\nProfessor Bot: Did you find all of those adjectives? Dan started with good - The mountain getaway; then he moved to better - The Deep Sea Adventure. And finally, he said the Safari Campout was the best vacation for Anna!\n\nAnna: Exactly what is the “latest vacation technology” … exactly?\n\nDan: I’m happy you asked. Meet the Travel Max 2000!\n\nAnna: Wow.\n\nDan: So, tell me, how do you like to travel?\n\nAnna: Well, I like travel that is cozy and romantic but still exciting.\n\nDan: Great. Tell me more.\n\nAnna: I like traveling in a plane but not in a helicopter! Planes are a little scary but helicopters are scarier! My favorite way of traveling is by train. Ships can be the scariest! Have you seen the movie “Titanic”? Oh, and no horses. But I will ride a camel. And no bike tours. Biking is THE slowest AND least romantic way to travel. Excuse me, but I think the Travel Max 2000 is on fire.\n\nDan: Yes, we’re both on fire! We really want to sell you the most ex-, I mean, best vacation ever!\n\nAnna: No, I mean it’s really on fire!\n\nDan: You killed it. You killed the Travel Max 2000!\n\nAnna: I am so sorry! Can I help you fix it?\n\nDan: No, no!\n\nAnna: Don’t cry. I know what you need -- a vacation!\n\nAnna: The Safari Campout looks fun. It is the priciest. But I think you deserve it.\n\nDan: No, no!\n\nProfessor Bot: Oh Anna. This is the smokiest lesson yet! There were a lot of comparatives and superlatives but … I can’t breathe.

Or the one that goes along the river in a boat?\n\nAnna: Both!\n\nPenelope: What? Anna, this isn’t going to be one of those trips, is it?\n\nAnna: No. Follow me.\n\nProfessor Bot: In this lesson, you are going to hear lots of prepositions! What’s a preposition, you ask? It’s a word that shows relationships between things. Anna says they are going on a tour through the city and along the river. Through and along are both prepositions.

That’s a lot of bathrooms!\n\nBoy: I’d be happy with two. I live in a house with my mom, four sisters, two aunts and only one bathroom!\n\nPenelope: Oh my! You know, Anna, we should give him a tip!\n\nAnna: Of course! It is polite to tip your tour guide! Luckily, I have lots of dollar bills!\n\nPenelope: That was a great Fun Fact! Here you go!\n\nBoy: Thank you! I can tell you Fun Facts all day!\n\nProfessor Bot: Did you hear any more prepositions of place? I heard \"between us and the president\" “inside the White House\" and \"in a house.\"\n\nAnd did you hear that the Duck Boat can go on the river? I don`t believe it.

        "dialog": "Anna: Thanks for meeting me.\n\nKelly: Sure.\n\nAnna: I’d like to get your advice on my latest project.\n\nKelly: Of course. I heard you were sent to cover a big food festival that has all kinds of barbecue. So, how did it go?\n\nAnna: Well, things started out great! But then, well, maybe you should watch it yourself.\n\nProf. Bot: Hi English learners! Your lesson today is about my favorite food -- barbecue! Your assignment is to find passive sentences. What are those, you might ask? In passive sentences the subject receives the action!\n\nFor example, “Anna was sent to cover a food festival.”\n\nPassive sentences have a form of the BE verb + the past participle of the main verb. This lesson is LOADED with passive sentences. Hey! That’s a passive sentence, too!\n\nOkay, now, it’s Barbecue Time!\n\nAnna: Today, a Barbecue Battle is being held in Washington, D.C. This festival, which is known as one of the biggest food festivals in the United States, brings together barbecue lovers from all over the country! Barbecue is meat that is cooked over an open fire or on a grill.\n\nChicken, pork and beef are all common meats to grill on a barbecue! No matter which meat you like to barbecue, the sauce is very important. Sauces are taken very seriously by chefs. Most ingredients are kept secret!\n\nSo, can you tell us what is in your barbecue sauce?\n\nChef 1: No, I can’t tell you.\n\nAnna: So, tell us, what is the secret ingredient in your barbecue sauce?\n\nChef 2: (says nothing.)\n\nAnna: Sauces are made by the barbecue chefs themselves. Most sauces are made with a tomato sauce, vinegar, and spices.\n\nProf. Bot: How many passive sentences did you find? Here is one I found:\nToday, a Barbecue Battle is being held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Now you try. Turn this sentence from passive to active.\n\nBarbecue is loved by Prof. Bot.\nProfessor Bot loves Barbecue!\nGood job! And yes, I do.\n\nAnna: There are some areas of the U.S. that are known for their tasty barbecue. The states of Texas, North and South Carolina and the cities of Memphis and Kansas City are known as the Barbecue Belt. People who are loyal to barbecue are really loyal to their favorite barbecue. That is why this festival is called a battle! Let’s ask a couple of people which barbecue is best.\n\nPerson 1: Texas, of course!\n\nPerson 2: Carolina barbecue is the very best.\n\nPerson 3: Kansas City!\n\nPerson 4: Memphis style!\n\nPerson 3: Kansas City!\n\nPerson 5: Texas!\n\nPerson 3: Kansas!\n\nPerson 5: Texas!\n\nPerson 3: Kansas!\n\nPerson 5: Texas!\n\nPerson 3: I say Kansas.\n\nPerson 5: Texas!\n\nPerson 3: She keeps saying Texas, I say Kansas.\n\nAnna: This is Anna Matteo reporting.\n\nAnna: Kelly, people feel so strongly about barbecue. Unbelievable! So, what do you think of my project?\n\nKelly: This is what I think. There is no way that Texas has the best barbecue. I am from Kansas City and we have THE best barbecue in the whole country. My mother and father owned a barbecue restaurant, which was really famous! So, I know barbecue! Anna, I know barbecue! I know barbecue! I know barbecue!\n\nProf Bot: Oh my. Kelly knows a lot about barbecue! And you know more about passive sentences! Be sure you go to the website to learn even more! Ah! Now, if you excuse me ..

So, tell me about the state fair.\n\nAnna: Oh, there were the usual things -- fair food, cute babies, music. But there must have been a dozen different contests! And some were pretty strange.\n\nAnna: There was a contest to see who could spit a watermelon seed the farthest. You should have seen all the people who wanted to spit a watermelon seed! And, it was pretty fun to watch. But Ashley, the pet contests were the best. There was a pet parade. Lots of people walked with their dogs.\n\nAshley: That sounds so fun. But Anna, tell me, how did you win a pet contest without a pet?\n\nAnna: Okay, the closest thing I have is my pet rock.\n\nAnna: I know it’s silly, but I’ve had it since I was a little girl. So, for a joke, I brought it to the fair. But then I was invited to enter the “One-of-Kind Pet” contest. And I won! (holds up first place ribbon)\n\nAshley: Anna, only you could have won a pet contest with a pet rock. I should have brought Dublin. He would’ve won a contest!\n\nAnna: It’s not very easy to win one of these. (shows her the blue ribbon) Does he have a costume?\n\nAnna: They had a costume contest. You should have seen this little girl. She and her dog wore matching princess costumes!\n\nAshley: Dublin doesn’t wear costumes.\n\nAnna: Does he know any tricks?\n\nAshley: Come this way. Now, watch this. (Dublin chases a toy)\n\nAnna: You caught it, Dublin! And you killed it! Good dog! Ashley, he could have won the Best Catch contest! Aw, good boy!

Where are your supplies?\n\nAnna: Pete, Pete, Pete. This could be the “blizzard of the century.”\n\nPete: It’ll be fine.\n\nKelly: How else had you prepared?\n\nAnna: Well, I had just bought the latest weather forecasting software. So, I brought it!\n\nKelly: Do you mean The Weather Genie Pro?\n\nAnna: You know it. Pete thought it was pretty great too.\n\nPete: Do you have any games on that thing?\n\nAnna: Yes! I have the best weather survival game. Boom!\n\nPete: Sounds fun.\n\nAnna: It is. But right now, Pete, this computer is a work tool. It will give us the temperature, wind speed, wind direction and amount of snowfall … in real time! Boom, boom!\n\nPete: I can’t wait.\n\nAnna: Pete, we need a name for this blizzard.\n\nPete: No, we don’t.\n\nAnna: All the great storms have names.\n\nPete: No, they don’t.\n\nAnna: I know -- “The Big Snow!”\n\nPete: I am not saying “The Big Snow.”\n\nPete: Welcome to “The Big Snow.”\n\nKelly: The Big Snow broke all kinds of records, didn’t it?\n\nAnna: Yes it did. And every time a record was broken, we celebrated!\n\nAnna: So far, in Washington, D.C. 29 inches of snow has fallen. That, my dear listeners, is a record! (Honks horn)\n\nAnna: We just broke the wind speed record! (Honks horn)\n\nAnna: Snow has been falling for 30 hours straight! That’s another record! (Honks horn. Pete comes into room and breaks the horn.)\n\nKelly: By Saturday night, stores and restaurants had closed. Did you bring enough food?\n\nAnna: I thought I had brought enough food. But I ran out.\n\nAnna: Hey, Pete, where is my bag of popcorn?\n\nPete: Maybe you ate it already.\n\nAnna: No, I didn’t.\n\nPete: I haven`t seen it. (Pete has popcorn in his beard.

        "dialog": "Anna: Wow. Did you know that bees are dying?\n\nKaveh: That is bad news. If all the bees died, there would be no food. Bees are very important.\n\n(buzz sound)\n\nAnna: Yes, they are. Speaking of bees, one of our little friends is here now.\n\nKaveh: You know, Anna, if you ignore it, it will fly away. But if you swat it, it might sting you.\n\nAnna: I’ll ignore it. I can ignore it. See, I’m ignoring it. (she is swatting at the bee)\n\nKaveh: Anna, are you afraid of bees?\n\nAnna: What makes you say that?\n\nKaveh: Anna, you should call my friend, Caroline. She is a beekeeper and a bee educator. If you talk to her, she’ll probably help you get over your fear of bees.\n\nAnna: I am not afraid of bees.\n\nKaveh: Here’s her card.\n\nAnna: Ahhh!\n\nProf. Bot: In this lesson, you can learn about conditionals. They have \"if\" and \"will\" or \"would.\" There are two kinds of conditional sentences in this lesson.\n\nType 1 conditionals have a real event, and a result that probably will happen. Chances are good. Here is the pattern:\n\nIf +present tense verb ... will + future tense verb.\n\nKaveh uses this when he says: \"If you ignore it, it will fly away.\"\n\nType 2 conditionals have a possible event and a result that may or may not happen. We don`t know. Here is the pattern:\n\nIf + past tense verb ...would + infinitive verb.\n\nKaveh uses this pattern when he says, \"If all the bees died, there would be no food.\"\n\nLook for the \"if\" in a sentence to find more conditionals in today`s lesson. I`ll color them, too!\n\nAnna: I think I`m at the wrong address. This does not look like a place where bees are kept. ​(knocks on door)\n\nAnna: Oh, sorry to bother you. I’m looking for beekeeper Caroline. I’m here to take her “Learn to Love Bees!” class.\n\nCaroline: You’re in the right place! I’m Caroline!\n\nAnna: Oh, nice to meet you! Um, Caroline, I thought this class used real bees and real hives.\n\nCaroline: It does! If you look in my backyard, you will see my bees! I’m a home beekeeper!\n\nAnna: What? You live with bees? That is really amazing! And at the same time really scary.\n\nCaroline: It’s not scary. If you come, I’ll show you.\n\nAnna: Caroline, how many bees are in that hive?\n\nCaroline: About thirty thousand (30,000) in each.\n\nAnna: What? That`s amazing! But, aren’t you afraid that they are gonna come out and kill you?\n\nCaroline: No, not at all, Anna. Even my children help me. Tell me, why are you afraid of bees?\n\nAnna: I don`t know. Well, when I was a little girl my mom ran out of honey. And I really wanted honey for my pancakes. So, I climbed high into a tree and hit a beehive with a stick … several times. Then I reached inside with my bare hands to pull the honey out. That’s when I got stung … a lot.\n\nAnna: Caroline, if you hit a beehive with a stick and reach inside, you might get stung.\n\nCaroline: No, Anna. If you do those things, you will get stung.\n\nAnna: Yes. I did.\n\nCaroline: And you know that it was your fault you got stung, don’t you?\n\nAnna: Yes. I did.\n\nCaroline: Bees know your feelings. And if you stay calm, the bees will be calm. If you`re nervous, the bees will be nervous. And if bees are nervous, they may sting. So, please be calm.\n\nAnna: I will be calm. I am calm. Okay, I`m ready. I`m ready\n\nCaroline: Great. Let’s get our equipment on.\n\nAnna: Wait! Wait! I’m not ready! I`m nervous! Give me a minute to be calm.\n\nProf. Bot: Are you ready for one more conditional sentence?\n\nIf you are not afraid, you will join us next time to learn more about bees!\n\n\nNEW WORDS:\nattack - v. to try to hurt, injure, or destroy (something or someone)\nbackyard - n. an area of grass behind someone`s house\nbare - adj. not covered by clothing, shoes or a hat\nbee - n. a black and yellow flying insect that can sting and that is often kept in hives for the honey that it produces\nbeekeeper - n. a person who raises bees\ncalm - adj. not angry, upset, or excited\nfault - n. responsibility for a problem, mistake, or bad situation\nhive - n. a nest for bees\nhoney - n. a thick, sweet substance made by bees\nignore - v. to refuse to show that you hear or see (something or someone)\nlocal - adj. relating to or occurring in a particular area, city, or town\nprobably - adv. very likely or almost certainly\nrun out of (something) - phrasal verb to use up the available supply of (something)\nsting - v. of an insect, plant, or animal - to hurt (someone) by piercing the skin with a sharp, pointed part that usually contains poison\nswat - v. to hit (someone or something) with a quick motion",

        "dialog": "Prof. Bot: We are back with Anna and Caroline and the bees. Last time, Anna was afraid. (Anna: I`m not afraid of bees!) But Caroline is helping her to stay safe. Look at sentences that start with \"If\" to find more conditional sentences. Remember, Type 1 conditionals use the present tense and \"will,\" and Type 2 use the past tense and \"would.\" Now, let`s find out what happens with Anna and the bees.\n\nCaroline: I have a feeling that your fear of bees will be gone soon. There are things beekeepers do to protect ourselves. For example, we wear protective clothing. This is a beekeeper’s veil, suit and gloves. There are other things we can do, too. If I use a smoker, the bees will stay calm.\n\nAnna: Let’s use smoke … lots of smoke.\n\nCaroline: Okay, Anna, that’s enough smoke. Another thing you can do is stay calm. Okay. When I lift the frame, you will see the bees.\n\nAnna: I’m ready. Let`s do this thing!\n\nCaroline: Okay, let`s put on our protective clothing.\n\nCaroline: I will carefully take out a frame. This is where the bees live. There are worker bees, drone bees and the queen bee. The bees have different jobs. The queen bee lays the eggs. The worker bees collect nectar and pollen ​from flowers and bring it back to the hive. Then they make honey! Now, you hold the frame. There are the bees.\n\nAnna: There are so many! And they are so busy! Now I know why we say, “busy as a bee!”\n\nCaroline: Good job, Anna.\n\nAnna: Caroline, bees are beautiful and important. If I wanted to help the bees, what would I do?\n\nCaroline: Great question. You can plant native flowers that bees like. Here’s a book to help you know which ones to plant.\n\nAnna: It’s a beautiful book. And look, it tells you which bees like which types of flowers.\n\nCaroline: It also tells you how the flowers affect the flavor of the honey.\n\nAnna: Flowers make a big difference to bees. If they don’t eat, they won’t live.\n\nCaroline: Buying local honey also helps the bees. If you want to help bees, do those two things.\n\nProf Bot: I learned a lot about bees. Hey, if I worked with bees, I would not need protective clothing! Guess what? That was a Type 2 conditional. And I heard a Type 1 conditional, too. (Anna: If they don’t eat, they won’t live.)\n\nAnna: Thanks for the book, Caroline, and the bee puppet and for teaching me about bees. Look … I’m not scared.\n\nCaroline: Good job, Anna. If you ever want to see the bees again, I’ll be here! You have my business card. I`ll let you see yourself out.\n\nAnna: Thanks! Bye! I will plant tons of flowers!\n\nBees: Thanks, Anna. (bees spell out the words)\n\nAnna: Sure thing, bees! Oh, and I`m sorry about hitting that hive when I was a little girl.\n\nBees: We love you, Anna. (bees make a heart sign.)\n\nAnna: Take care, bees! (to herself) Which way is the Metro?\n\nBees: That way. (they draw an arrow)\n\nAnna: Thanks!\n\nProf. Bot: So, if I you want to learn more about bees, visit your local beekeeper like Anna did. Maybe you can try some local honey, too.\n\nNow it’s your turn. Practice making conditional sentences. If you practice, you will become better at them. That`s type 1!\n\n\nNEW WORDS:\naffect - v. to act on (someone or something) and cause a change\ndifference - n. the quality that makes one person or thing unlike another\nflavor - n. the quality of something that you can taste\nflower the part of a plant that is often brightly colored, that usually lasts a short time, and from which the seed or fruit develops\nframe - n. an open structure that holds something\nlift - v. to move (something or someone) to a higher position (raise)\nlocal - adj. relating to or occurring in a particular area, city, or town\nnative - adj. produced, living, or existing naturally in a particular region\nnectar - n. a sweet liquid produced by plants and used by bees in making honey\npollen - n. the very fine usually yellow dust that is produced by a plant and that is carried to other plants of the same kind usually by wind or insects so that the plants can produce seeds\nprotective - adj. used to protect someone or something : giving or meant to give protection\nsmoker - n. a piece of equipment used for making smoke\nveil - n. something that covers or hides something else",

How do you put them together?\n\nPete says, \"She can’t whistle and I can’t either.\"\n\nYou can see we just add the conjunction “either” and take away the verb “whistle.” And Ashley says: \"I don’t like ball sports and he doesn’t either!\"\n\nKeep looking for connectors!\n\nAshley: You met someone, Anna? That’s great! What’s his name?\n\nAnna: His name? His name is uh… (stalling, looks around, sees a bus) Bus … ter.

You can bring Buster.\n\nPete: (laughing) Yeah, I can’t wait to meet him.\n\nAnna: Thanks, Ashley, but he’s really busy tonight with his uh, (looks around, sees squirrel) squirrel collection. Bye, guys! Gotta go!\n\nAshley: Squirrel collection?\n\nPete: You know, she made all that up.\n\nAshley: That’s so sad. She needs to meet someone.

Can he come tonight?\n\nAnna: That’s the sad part. You see, he just got a job as a spy, and tonight he leaves on assignment.\n\nPete: Of course he does.\n\nAnna: But that`s okay, because now I know that there is someone out there made for me. (looks at the time) Oh, it’s late! I have to see him off at the train station. Bye, you guys!\n\nAshley: Bye Anna! Oh dear, she’s worse than we thought.\n\nPete: She’s lost her mind.\n\nAshley: What should we do?\n\nPete: (happy, excited) Let’s tell her!\n\n(Pete goes to leave but Ashley pulls him back.)\n\nAshley: No, Pete. Mr. Right may not be real but he makes her really happy.\n\nProfessor Bot: Did you find any other connectors? Notice how the words are in a different order in the part after “so.” \"I am\" becomes \"am I\" and \"he can\" becomes \"can he.\"\n\"He’s good at flying kites and so am I. I can play the ukulele and so can he.\"\n\n\nNEW WORDS:\nboyfriend - n. a man that someone is having a romantic or sexual relationship with\ncollection - n. a group of interesting or beautiful objects brought together in order to show or study them or as a hobby\ncouple- n. two people who are married or who have a romantic or sexual relationship\ngirlfriend - n. a woman that someone is having a romantic or sexual relationship with\nin common - expression. people who have something in common share interests, beliefs, attitudes, or opinions\nkite - n. a toy that is made of a light frame covered with cloth, paper, or plastic and that is flown in the air at the end of a long string\nlie - v. to say or write something that is not true in order to deceive someone\nmake (something) up - phrasal verb. created from the imagination or not true or real\nMr. Right - expression. the ideal future husband\npartner - n. someone`s husband or wife or the person someone has sexual relations with\nsquirrel - n. a small animal with a long tail and soft fur that lives in trees\nsee (someone) off - phrasal verb. to go to an airport, train station with (someone who is leaving) in order to say goodbye\ntruth - n. the real facts about something\nwhistle - v. to make a high sound by blowing air through your lips or teeth",

Because I’m from Alaskan wilderness, I’m skilled in all outdoor activities of the wild.\n\nAnna: That’s great but what about speed walking?\n\nAlaskan Albert: Speed walking? That`s funny! Since I’ve been living in the city, I’ve combined wilderness training with a city workout. I call it “Call of the Wild Parkour!” (He howls like a wolf.)\n\nAnna: Okay … but seriously, when do we speed walk?\n\nAlaskan Albert: Your application did not say how funny you are!\n\nAnna: No. But it did say that I`m a speed walker!

I really need to find my key. Yeah!\n\nSerenity: Yes, we need to find the key … the key to happiness.\n\nAnna: No, no. I just need to find the key to my apartment.\n\nSerenity: I used to know. But now I don`t! Do you, Anna?\n\nAnna: I don’t know. I think I left it in the ladies’ room. You know, this isn’t the Lost & Found, is it?\n\n(Anna starts walking out of the room)\n\nSerenity: It could be the Lost & Found. I’m lost! And I used to find joy for people! I used to find joy!\n\nAnna: You know, this is a bad time for you. I’ll find the Lost & Found myself. Bye, thanks.\n\nSerenity: I used to find joy. I used to find joy! I used to find joy!\n\nAnna: Ah, I found my key!\n\nSerenity: I used to find joy!\n\nPofessor Bot: Oh no. Serenity lost her joy. But at least Anna found her key!

        "dialog": "Ms. Weaver: Anna, Pete, I have a new assignment for you -- a show on single parents! What is it like for a mother or a father to raise a child by herself or himself?\n\nAnna: We can interview single parents. They can share their experiences themselves.\n\nMs. Weaver: Yes, but you need to experience parenthood yourselves.\n\nAnna: Ourselves?\n\nPeter: Yeah, how do we do that? We’re not parents.\n\nMs. Weaver: I asked myself the same question. I said, \"Caty, how are they gonna do that?\" Then an idea came to me. I will give you the babies!\n\nProfessor Bot: You may be asking yourself the same thing that I’m asking myself: what is Ms. Weaver talking about!? I am sure we will find out shortly.\n\nThis lesson teaches reflexive pronouns.\n\nReflexive pronouns refer back to the subject of a sentence or clause. We use them when the subject and the object are the same person or thing.\n\nFor example, Ms. Weaver says, “I asked myself the same question.”\n\n“I” is the subject and “myself” refers back to it. Here, she would not use the pronoun “me.” You need to use the reflexive pronoun “myself.”\n\nReflexive pronouns are easy to find: they end in “self” or “selves.” I have a feeling we are going to see a lot of reflexive pronouns. Listen for them!\n\n(Pete and Anna continue their meeting with Ms. Weaver. She puts two bags of flour on the table. Pete and Anna still look confused.)\n\nMs. Weaver: Here are your babies!\n\nPete: Those are bags of flour.\n\nMs. Weaver: No, Pete, for the next six days, this is your baby. Here are your instructions. Do not leave your babies alone. A baby cannot take care of itself. And you two must do everything by yourselves.\n\nWe will meet next Friday. Oh, and the person who does the best research will get an extra day of vacation. Help yourself to a baby.\n\nAnna: Pete, look, my baby is organic and whole grain. Your baby is ordinary.\n\n(Pete pushes her flour baby off desk.)\n\nAnna: (to Pete) Monster! (to Caty) This is a great idea, Ms. Weaver!\n\n(Pete and Anna are now outside.)\n\nPete: This is a terrible idea.\n\nAnna: Speak for yourself, Pete! We need to throw ourselves into the research! I’m starting right now!\n\n(She leaves but forgets her Flour Baby.)\n\nPete: Hey Anna, you forgot your baby!\n\n(She turns and looks at Pete.)\n\nAnna: Come to mama!\n\n(The bag of flour flies at her. She catches it.)\n\nAnna: Good girl! Good girl!\n\nProfessor Bot: Singular reflexive pronouns end in “self.” Plural ones end in “selves.”\n\nAnna says, “We need to throw ourselves into the research!” The subject “we” is plural. So, we must use the plural reflexive pronoun “ourselves.”\n\n(The parenting research begins. Anna tries to open a baby stroller but can’t. A man walking by helps her. She pushes Flour Baby in the stroller but it falls out. On another day, she jogs with it. After several days, she is tired!)\n\nAnna: This is hard! I hope Pete is not doing well. I really need that vacation day!\n\nProfessor Bot: We will all see how Pete is doing in the next episode. We’ll also learn when not to use reflexive pronouns.\n\n\n\nNEW WORDS:\nexperience – n. the process of doing and seeing things and of having things happen to you\ngonna – informal. In casual conversation, most Americans change “going to” to “gonna.”\ninstructions – n. statements that describe how to do something\nordinary – adj. normal or usual\nmonster – n. an extremely cruel or evil person\nparenthood – n. the state of being a mother or father\nrefer – v. to have a direct connection or relationship to something\nsingle – adj. not married or not having a serious romantic relationship with someone\nspeak for yourself - expression. something you say to someone to say that the opinion that they have just expressed is not the same as your opinion\nstroller - n. a small carriage with four wheels that a baby or small child can ride in while someone pushes it​\nterrible – adj. very shocking and upsetting\nthrow (reflexive pronoun) into – expression. to begin to do something with great energy and determination",

        "dialog": "Professor Bot: In Part 1 of this two-part lesson, Ms. Weaver gave Anna and Pete an assignment. Ms. Weaver instructed them to do everything by themselves.\n\n“Themselves” is a reflexive pronoun.\n\nIn today’s lesson, Ms. Weaver will look at Pete’s and Anna’s research. First, let’s see Pete’s experiment.\n\n(Pete throws the bag of flour on his chair and throws many other things on his flour baby. Next, we see him outside enjoying ice-cream without his flour baby.)\n\nMs. Weaver: Okay, Pete, let me see your research first.\n\n(Pete hands her a big binder filled with research.)\n\nMs. Weaver: That’s a heavy binder. And you and your Baby look great.\n\nPete: Thanks, Ms. Weaver. We feel great!\n\nMs. Weaver: Anna. Anna, you’re next. Anna? Anna wake up!\n\n(She wakes up but is very confused.)\n\nAnna: I`m here, Baby! I’m here! I’m here! Here`s your bottle.\n\n(She accidentally squirts her bottle and milk goes everywhere.)\n\nMs. Weaver: Anna, you and your baby look awful. What happened?\n\nAnna: Well, I took her everywhere. Everywhere. And I fed her every three hours. So, I haven’t slept since … what day is it?\n\nMs. Weaver: It’s Friday. What happened there?\n\n(Ms. Weaver points to a large bandage on Anna’s flour baby.)\n\nAnna: Oh, that. Oh, that. I was making myself a salad and had a little accident with a knife. I put my flour baby in front of me. And then I accidentally stabbed it. But I gave it First Aid!\n\nMs. Weaver: Is that a burn?\n\nAnna: Yes. Yes it is. While I was making myself dinner, I put Baby next to me. I accidentally knocked her into the sink. So I put her in the microwave to dry. That’s when she caught fire.\n\n(Pete smiles, thinking he’s won.)\n\nProfessor Bot: Okay. So, we use a reflexive pronoun when it refers to the subject of a sentence or clause.\n\nBut we DON’T use a reflexive pronoun with prepositions of place.\n\nAnna uses examples of both in one sentence: While I was making myself dinner, I put Baby next to me.\n\nWe use a reflexive pronoun in the first part of the sentence. “Myself” refers to the subject “I.”\n\nBut in the second part of the sentence, we don’t use a reflexive pronoun in the prepositional phrase. We use the pronoun “me.” Why? “next to” is a preposition of place.\n\n(Back in the meeting room, we’re about to learn who won the parenting experiment. Pete is smiling, thinking he won.)\n\nMs. Weaver: Anna, Anna, you should be very proud of yourself.\n\nPete: Proud? She stabbed and burned her baby!! And she only did one page of research…and it’s covered in milk. Ew.\n\nMs. Weaver: Yes, Pete. But she followed instructions.\n\nPete: Hey, I did ...\n\nMs. Weaver: Please, Pete. Anna, I think your baby has lost some weight. Is there something else you want to share?\n\nAnna: Yes. I’d like to share … these! I made them myself this morning.\n\nPete: You baked your baby? You should be ashamed of yourself!\n\nAnna: I baked them at the end of the experiment, Pete. At that point, this was just a bag of flour.\n\nPete: It was always just a bag of flour!!\n\nMs. Weaver: Pete, will you listen to yourself?! You sound crazy.\n\nPete: I sound crazy! This whole experiment was crazy!! She was the one who carried around and fed it and ...\n\n(Anna puts a cookie into his mouth. He chews it and begins to smile.)\n\nPete: Mmm. That is good.\n\n(They all agree and eat the cookies.)\n\nProfessor Bot: So, what have we learned? We’ve learned when to use reflexive pronouns and when not to.\n\nGo to our website for more information! You can practice using reflexive pronouns in our comments section.\n\n\nNEW WORDS:\naccidentally – adj. happening in a way that is not planned or intended\nashamed – adj. feeling shame or guilt\nbake – v. to make food, such as bread and cake, by preparing a dough, batter, etc., and cooking it in an oven using dry heat\nbandage – n. a covering, such as a strip of cloth, that protects or supports part of the body that has been hurt\nbinder – n. a cover for holding together sheets of paper\nbottle – n. a glass or plastic container that has a narrow neck and usually has no handle\nburn – n. an injury caused by fire, heat or acid\nburn – v. to destroy or damage something by fire or heat\ncookie – n. a sweet baked food that is usually small, flat, and round and is made from flour and sugar\ndry – v. to remove water or moisture from something or someone\nFirst Aid – n. emergency treatment given to a sick or injured person\nknife – n. a usually sharp blade attached to a handle that is used for cutting\nknock – v. to touch or hit someone or something in a way that is not planned or intended\nmicrowave – n. an oven in which food is cooked or heated quickly by very short waves of electromagnetic energy\nsquirt – v. to suddenly force a liquid out through a small opening\nstab – v. to wound someone or something with a pointed object, such as a knife",

        "dialog": "Anna: Hi, can you tell me how to get to your movie theater?\n\n(Movie theater worker on the phone gives directions.)\n\nAnna: Oh, that’s easy. OK, thank you. Bye.\n\n(Anna meets Pete outside of the theater.)\n\nAnna: Hi, Pete! Thanks for the movie invitation.\n\nPete: Yeah, sure Anna.\n\nAnna: I love movies. I love the plot! I love the set design! I love the costumes! I love -\n\nPete: Anna, I take movies very seriously. You`re not one of those people who talks during a movie, are you?\n\nAnna: No.\n\nPete: Good.\n\nProfessor Bot: Anna loves movies. And..she loves talking about movies. And Pete doesn’t sound happy about that.\n\nBut he’s trying to be polite. He can do that with Indirect Questions.\n\nWe can ask a question directly: Where is your movie theater? or indirectly as Anna does:\n\nAnna: Can you tell me how to get to your movie theater?\n\nThey have the same meaning. But indirect questions are more polite and a little more formal.\n\nMany indirect questions begin with:\n\nCan/Could you tell me…\nWould/Do you mind…\nWould it be possible…\n\nor\n\nDo you know…\n\nHmm, do you know if Anna will stop talking? I sure don’t.\n\nKeep watching. And, this time look for indirect questions that begin with: Would you mind…\n\nAnna: I love the smell of popcorn. I love seats that rock.\n\n(Her chair makes noise as she rocks back and forth.)\n\nPete: I love when people are quiet.\n\n(The lights go down and we see movie light on their faces.)\n\nAnna: Ooh look, the previews are starting. I love to see what movies are coming out. Oh, this one looks good!\n\nPete: Anna, the previews are part of the movie experience. So, would you mind not talking?\n\nAnna: Oh, sure, sure.\n\n(Anna eats her popcorn loudly. Then, she begins drinking her milkshake loudly.)\n\nPete: Anna, I was wondering: are you almost finished with that?\n\nAnna: No. There`s still a lot of milkshake at the bottom.\n\n(She drinks loudly again. And again.)\n\nPete: Anna, do you mind not drinking so loudly?\n\nAnna: I`ll try. But it`s really thick.\n\n(She moves the straw around and makes even more noise.)\n\nPete: Anna, what are you doing?!\n\n(A person in the audience shushes Pete.)\n\nPerson in audience: Shh!\n\n(Pete tells the person what was happening.)\n\nPete: I’m not the one making all the noise.\n\nPerson in audience: Shhh!\n\nAnna: I’m done now.\n\n(Anna now holds many noisy boxes of candy. Finally, she chooses a candy bar.)\n\nPete: Anna, would you mind opening that a little bit more quietly?\n\nAnna: I`ll try.\n\n(She tries to open it quietly but cannot.)\n\nPete: Anna, just give it to me!\n\n(He tears it open with his mouth. It makes a loud noise. Again, someone in the audience thinks he is making too much noise.)\n\nPerson in audience: Shhh!\n\nPete: (to the person) It`s not mine. I`m opening it for her. Here.\n\nPerson in audience: Shhhhhh!!\n\n(He gives the candy bar quickly back to her.)\n\nPete: Here!\n\nAnna: Thanks, Pete.\n\nPete: Now, would you mind being more quiet?\n\n(The light of someone’s phone shines in Pete’s face. He asks the person a question.)\n\nPete: Excuse me, would you mind turning down your phone light?\n\n(Then, Anna’s phone rings.)\n\nAnna: Oh, sorry! I forgot to turn my phone off.\n\n(She tries to turn it off but drops it under the seat.)\n\nAnna: Oh no! I dropped it. Where is it?\n\n(She looks under the seat in front of her.)\n\nPete: Anna, can you please turn off your phone?\n\n(She speaks to the person Pete just asked to turn their phone light down.)\n\nAnna: Excuse me, would you mind lending me your phone light for a minute?\n\nPete: No! I’ll get it!\n\nPerson in audience: Shhhhh!\n\n(People shush Pete again. He finally has had enough.)\n\nPete: Look, people, I’m not the noisy one here! So, you all need to shush the right person. And I should know about shushing! I shush people all the time!!\n\nSecurity guard: Excuse me, sir. You can’t yell in a movie theater. Would you mind coming with me?\n\nPete: You`re kicking me out? Me? But I’m always the quiet one in the movie!\n\n(The security guard takes Pete out. Anna watches the movie and eats quietly from her bag of popcorn.)\n\nAnna: Pete should know better. You have to be quiet in a movie theater. Shh, the movie’s starting!\n\nProfessor Bot: Well, that’s a surprise! I thought Anna would be the noisy one.\n\nWell, she was … with her food. But Pete did all of the talking.

        "dialog": "Anna: (to Penelope) That’s a great idea. (to Rick) Rick, I think we should use this as the opening shot.\n\nPenelope: Anna, did Ms. Weaver give us instructions for covering the car show?\n\nAnna: She did. She said that we need to show lots of cars. She said we need to interview people. And she also said that we should have fun.\n\nPenelope: Those were her exact words?\n\nAnna: Yeah. She said, “Have fun, Anna!” And she is the boss.\n\nAnna: (to Rick) Okay, Rick, are you - are you ready? OK. Hello, I`m Anna Matteo. Welcome to the Washington Car Show!\n\nAnna: People all over town are saying that if you like cars, this is the place to be! So, let`s see what people are talking about. (at Rick) How was that? Okay? Is that Good?\n\nProfessor Bot: Anna, Penelope and Rick are making a news story about the Washington Car Show. Ms. Weaver gave them instructions.\n\nWe often need to tell others what someone else said.\n\nThere are two ways to do this. One is to use the person’s exact words and use quotation marks. We call this \"direct speech.\"\n\nFor example, Ms. Weaver had said, “You need to show lots of cars.”\n\nThe other way is to talk about what someone said. We call this \"reported speech.\"\n\nAnna tells Penelope: She said that we need to show lots of cars.\n\nIn this sentence, \"she,\" is the subject, “said” is the reporting verb, “that” is the conjunction and “we need to show lots of cars” is the reporting clause.\n\nKeep watching, and listen for sentences where Anna talks about what someone else said!\n\nAnna: This car show has many styles of vehicles. There are utility vehicles, classic cars, trucks, sports cars, and everyday vehicles.\n\nPenelope: Okay, I think we got good interviews.\n\nAnna: Me too! People had very different opinions. But they all said they loved cars.\n\nPenelope: Anna, look -- a robot!\n\nAnna: A robot!\n\nPenelope: A robot!\n\nAnna: Rick, we have to use the robot in the show!\n\n(They walk over to the robot. Anna begins to dance like a robot.)\n\nRobot: What is your first name?\n\nAnna: Anna! Anna!\n\nRobot: Anna, you know, what an effort. What an effort to robot dance. How about a round of applause for Anna! I’ve never seen anyone try so hard.\n\nAnna: Penelope, did you hear that? Hank the Robot said that he has never seen anyone dance like me.\n\nPenelope: Uh, I think many people here are saying that, Anna.\n\nAnna: That was fun. You know what someone told me? You can test drive a Jaguar at this car show.\n\nPenelope: Now, that sounds fun.\n\nAnna: Let’s go.\n\nPenelope: Okay.\n\nAnna: This course is smooth. So you can drive faster.\n\nAnna: He said...that I can’t drive, unfortunately.\n\n(They begin the test drive. Kurt, the stunt driver, does the driving.)\n\nAnna: Oh my gosh…reverse.\n\nAnna: That was great. This is awesome.\n\nKurt: Are you ready to go on the rollercoaster?\n\nAnna: I’m ready.\n\nKurt: Here we go!\n\nAnna: That’s awesome.\n\nAnna: That was...That was awesome! I just want to go one more time. I promise. That’s it. Just one more time.\n\nAnna: This course is bumpy and uneven. I was told that I could drive this course. So I am.\n\nAnna: (to Rick) Okay, Rick, are you rolling? Awesome. Okay, this course is uneven. But I think the ride will be smooth.\n\nAnna: Ooh. This hill is really steep.\n\nAnna: Oh my gosh. I can’t tell you how much fun this is.\n\nAnna: Penelope, that was so much fun! I think I need to go again.\n\nPenelope: Uh, Anna, I think we have enough test drive video.\n\nAnna: Ms. Weaver said to get a lot. So, I think I should go again. (to Rick) Rick, I’m going to go again. Until next time!\n\nPenelope: But I want to get lunch, Anna!\n\nProfessor Bot: Penelope said she wants to go to lunch.

Now, speaking of Pete’s birthday, what else should I do? I know. I’ll rent him a clown!\n\nAshley: Yeah, he’ll never speak to you again.\n\nProfessor Bot: Did you hear Ashley and Anna using the words talk and speak?\n\nTalk and speak both mean “to say words.” And, many times, you can use either word without losing any meaning. But there are some differences in when we use these words.\n\nThe word talk is usually used:\n\nfor conversations between two or more people\nand informal situations, such as between friends or family\nFor example, Ashley asks Anna: “Are you talking to yourself again?”\n\nSpeak is usually used:\n\nfor one-way communication, such as presentations\nformal situations, such as a boss speaking with her workers\nto talk about language ability\nand in polite requests\nKeep watching, and listen for the words talk and speak.\n\n(Anna goes to Tanglewood Works.)\n\nSue: Hey there. Welcome to Tanglewood Works! I’m Sue. How can I help you today?\n\nAnna: Hi Sue, I’m Anna. A friend told me about your store. She said, “Anna, this place is really unique!”\n\nSue: We are! Here at Tanglewood Works, we focus on things that are handmade, reclaimed and recycled.\n\nAnna: Wow! That is really good for the environment.\n\nSue: It’s good for you too. Local artists made all of these one-of-a-kind pieces. And I paint most of the furniture.\n\nAnna: Can I look around?\n\nSue: Oh, please do.\n\n(Anna walks around the store.)\n\nSue: So, Anna, do you like to make things?\n\nAnna: Me? Oh, no. Every time I try to make something, something goes wrong.\n\n(She knocks down many things.)\n\nAnna: Oh, sorry. Sorry.\n\nSue: It’s okay. Anna, everybody can make something.\n\nAnna: Sue, this piece is very interesting!\n\nSue: You know, when I found these pieces, they were broken and in a dumpster. But they spoke to me. And they said, “Save me, Sue! Save me!”\n\nAnna: Sue, what do you mean they “spoke” to you?\n\nSue: When I see something special that someone has thrown away, I can almost hear it talk.\n\nAnna: It’s not saying anything!\n\nSue: Anna, it’s not easy to see the treasure in trash.\n\nAnna: Or hear it talk.\n\nSue: But you can learn. In fact, I teach private classes. And one is called Turning Trash to Treasure.\n\nSue: Next week, bring in some trash and we’ll turn it into treasure. Just remember – pick some trash that “speaks” to you.\n\nAnna: Got it! I’ll see you next week!\n\nProfessor Bot: Will Anna find trash that “speaks” to her? What will it say? We’ll find out next week!\n\n\nNEW WORDS:\nability - n. the power or skill of doing something\ncake – n. a sweet baked food made from a mixture of flour, sugar, and other ingredients (such as eggs and butter)\ncommunication – n. the act or process of using words to express your ideas, thoughts, feelings,\nconversation – n. an informal talk involving two people or a small group of people\ndefinitely – adv. in a way that is certain or clear\ndumpster – n. a large trash container\nfurniture – n. chairs, tables, beds, et cetera that are used to make a room ready for use\nfocus – v. to direct your attention or effort at something specific\nhandmade – adj. made with your hands or by using hand tools\nenvironment – n. the natural world\nlocal – adj. located or living nearby\none-of-a-kind – adj. used to say that something is the only one of its kind\npolite – adj. having or showing good manners or respect for other people\npresent – n. gift\npresentation – n. an activity in which someone shows, describes, or explains something to a group of people\nprivate – adj. for the use of a single person or group\nreclaimed – adj. describes getting (a usable thing) from materials that have been used before\nrecycled – adj. describes something new that was made from something used before\nrequest – n. an act of politely or formally asking for something\nsituation – n. the facts, conditions and events that affect someone or something at a particular time and in a particular place\nstrange – adj. different from what is usual, normal, or expected\ntrash – n. things that are no longer useful or wanted and that have been thrown away\ntreasure – n. something that is very special, important or valuable\nunique – adj. used to say that something or someone is unlike anything or anyone else",

        "dialog": "Sue: Welcome to class, Anna. I can’t wait to see your trash!\n\nSue: Oh, okay. Alright, it’s a -- it’s a net with a … oh, it’s got a hole in it. Tell me about that.\n\nAnna: This net said to me, “Anna, I used to catch stuff. I don’t anymore. So, use me, Anna.” That’s what it said. It said, “Use me, Anna.”\n\nSue: Okay. So...it’s a plastic helmet.\n\nAnna: This plastic helmet said, “Anna. Hey, Anna, find me a head.”\n\nSue: Okay, um...and a broken toy.\n\nAnna: This broken toy … this broken toy said to me – it said, “Anna, help me find fun.” “Help me, Anna” is what it said.\n\nSue: Anna, this stuff is not saying anything to you or me or anyone. It’s what we like to call in the business … garbage.\n\nAnna: But you said to bring in trash.\n\nSue: Sometimes trash is treasure. Sometimes it`s just trash.\n\nSue: Anna, don’t worry. Next week, I could teach you decoupage.\n\nAnna: Decoupage. Decoupage. That’s fun to say.\n\nSue: All you need to bring is a clean shoe box. A box that held shoes.\n\nAnna: I got it. I got it! See you next week!\n\nProf. Bot: Ut oh. It looks like Anna doesn’t know the difference between treasure and trash. She thinks those things are telling her something!\n\nProf. Bot: The words tell and say have similar meanings. But we use them in different ways.\n\nProf Bot: Tell means “to inform or instruct someone with words” and is almost always followed by an indirect object. For example, Sue says, “Tell me about that.”\n\nProf. Bot: The word me is the indirect object and tells us who is being told.\n\nProf. Bot: Say means “to express something with words” and focuses more on the words used. For example, Anna says, “That’s what it said. It said, ‘Use me, Anna.’”\n\nProf. Bot: Listen for when Anna and Sue use tell and say.\n\nSue: Anna, welcome to Decoupage class. Decoupage is just gluing pretty pictures onto stuff.\n\n(Sue gets a phone call.)\n\nSue: Anna, I’ve got to talk to this person. I’ll be right back. Don’t start without me.\n\nAnna: Got it.\n\n(Sue leaves to take her phone call. Anna gets glue everywhere. She becomes covered with glue and paper.)\n\nAnna: Okay. I can fix this.\n\nSue: Anna, what happened? I told you to wait for me!\n\nAnna: Actually, you told me not to start without you, which I didn’t. Your glue is really sticky.\n\nSue: Next week, let’s try lamp making. There’s – there’s no glue. Here`s a flier.\n\nAnna: Thanks. See you next week.\n\nSue: Anna, you did really well this week. I think lamp making might be your thing!\n\nAnna: Thanks, Sue. I did everything you told me to do.\n\nSue: Remember: I said to read the instructions really carefully. Where are those instructions?\n\nAnna: Let’s just plug it in!\n\n(Anna plugs in the lamp and, suddenly, the city loses electricity.)\n\nAnna: So, what class will you be teaching next week?\n\nProf. Bot: Too bad Anna didn’t follow instructions!

Anna, are you there?\r\n\r\nProfessor Bot: Anna and Ms. Weaver used the future continuous verb tense to talk about the interview.\r\n\r\nProf. Bot: We use future continuous to talk about actions that will be in progress at or around a time in the future.\r\n\r\nProf. Bot: For example, Ms. Weaver says, “Tomorrow, you’ll be interviewing musician Emma G.”\r\n\r\nProf. Bot: There are two options for future continuous.

I listen to your music a lot. So, I feel like I know you. Is that strange?\r\n\r\nEmma G: Anna, listening to music can be a very personal experience. So, no, that’s not strange.\r\n\r\nAnna: Good because I made something for you -- a video scrapbook of our friendship.\r\n\r\nAnna: I took photos of you and added myself. I worked on it all weekend.\r\n\r\nEmma G: Well, that -- that’s strange. Is that even -- is that even legal?\r\n\r\nAnna: Now, Emma, let’s talk about your schedule. Tell me ... I mean, tell us exactly where you will be and when. Exactly.\r\n\r\nEmma G: Sure. Well, in early June, I’ll be performing at several venues across Austin, Texas.\r\n\r\nAnna: That’s my vacation week. I can meet you there! We can tour the city. We can have lunch.\r\n\r\nEmma G: Um, yeah maybe. Then in mid-July, I’m going to be teaching at a music camp in Chicago.\r\n\r\nAnna: I’ll be visiting my sister then. She only lives about six hours from Chicago! I could drive over. We could hang out.\r\n\r\nEmma G: Yeah, uh maybe. You know, maybe now is a good time for some music.\r\n\r\nAnna: That’s a great idea.

        "dialog": "ANNA: Hi! I see you like superhero culture. Me too.\n\nANNA: In fact, tonight I’m going to the big superhero convention. Are you going?\n\nYOUNG MAN: Um, I don’t know.\n\nANNA: Well, you`d better decide soon. Last year, it sold out.\n\nANNA: So, since we’re talking about superheroes: would you rather become a superhero by accident, like Spiderman, or be born a superhero, like Wonder Woman?\n\nANNA: Take your time. It’s a big question. I thought about it for days –\n\nYOUNG MAN: Okay. If I had to choose, I’d rather be born a superhero.\n\nANNA: I’d rather become a superhero by an unexpected accident!\n\nYOUNG MAN: Aren’t all accidents unexpected?\n\nANNA: Well, yeah.\n\nYOUNG MAN: What was that!? Are you okay?\n\nANNA: I`m better than okay. I feel super!\n\nPROF. BOT: Oh No! Anna was just hit by lightning. She had better get help.\n\nPROF. BOT: We use had better to give advice. It is very informal and stronger than should and ought to. For example, Anna says: “You`d better decide soon. Last year, it sold out.”\n\nPROF. BOT: When we use had better, we usually shorten the word had for personal pronouns.\n\nPROF. BOT: We use would rather to say what we or someone else prefers to do or have. For example, the boy says: “Okay. If I had to choose, I’d rather be born a superhero.\n\nPROF. BOT: With would rather, we also shorten the word would when used with personal pronouns. Keep watching and listen for had better and would rather.\n\nYOUNG MAN: You’d better see a doctor.\n\nANNA: I’ve never felt better!\n\nYOUNG MAN: You were just struck by lightning!! And what happened to your hair and your clothes?\n\nANNA: I don`t know. Wait, I do know. This is my super suit! And this is my origin story.\n\nYOUNG MAN: What are you talking about?\n\nANNA: An origin story tells the beginning of a superhero. You should know that.\n\nYOUNG MAN: You`re not making any sense, lady.\n\nANNA: I would rather be called Lightning Bolt Lady! It’ll sound great in a theme song: Lightning Bolt Lady!\n\nANNA: Now, I need to find my superpowers --\n\nYOUNG MAN: Um, I really think --\n\nANNA: Wait. Don’t tell me. I’ll read your mind. You are thinking you’d like to be my super helper.\n\nYOUNG MAN: I was not thinking that.\n\nANNA: ... that you’d like to live in a treehouse.\n\nYOUNG MAN: No.\n\nANNA: … that you should eat more vegetables.\n\nYOUNG MAN: Please, stop talking. You really should get some help.\n\nANNA: Mind reading is not my superpower. Maybe I can become invisible. I … am … invisible!\n\nANNA: You can’t see me. Who am I? I’m not here. You can’t see me.\n\nYOUNG MAN: I can see you and so can everybody else.\n\nANNA: No power of invisibility. Maybe I can create a force field. I feel it working. Nothing can hurt –\n\n(Someone throws a piece of paper and it hits her head.)\n\nANNA: Ow, that wasn’t very nice. I see I have a lot of work to do. Well, goodbye, non-super person!\n\nYOUNG MAN: Wait. I’d better go with you. You might get worse…if that’s even possible.\n\nANNA: That`s very nice of you, ordinary human. But I’d rather go by myself. This is a quest.\n\nYOUNG MAN: Every time you speak, I get more confused.\n\nANNA: A quest is a part of all superhero stories. You really need to work on your superhero studies. Now, stand back. I’ve never flown before.\n\nYOUNG MAN: And you’re not flying now.\n\nANNA: Flying is also not my superpower. That’s too bad. It`s going to be expensive to Uber everywhere. You know, I`d rather walk. It’s a nice day. Goodbye, non-super person.\n\nYOUNG MAN: I am not talking to strangers again.\n\nANNOUNCER: Will Lightning Bolt Lady find her superpowers … ever? Ouch! Did that brick wall hurt?

And they had been talking about superheroes for a while when suddenly Anna became Lightning Bolt Lady!\n\nANNOUNCER: She tried to find her superpowers. But it did not go well.\n\nANNOUNCER: She can’t fly, become invisible or create a force field. And she really cannot walk through walls. Ouch, Lightning Bolt Lady.\n\nANNOUNCER: She had been walking into that wall for about 15 minutes when she had a great idea.\n\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: I just had a great idea!\n\nANNOUNCER: I can’t wait to hear this one! But first, let’s talk about grammar.\n\nANNOUNCER: Professor Bot is on vacation this week. I’m the announcer. So, I’m going to tell you about the past perfect continuous.\n\nANNOUNCER: We use this verb tense to show that an action started in the past and continued to another time or action in the past.\n\nANNOUNCER: For example, I said, “She had been walking into that wall for about 15 minutes when she had a great idea.”\n\nANNOUNCER: Had been walking is the past perfect continuous of the verb walk. It’s had been plus the -ing form of the verb.\n\nANNOUNCER: You’ll hear me use this verb tense a few more times today.\n\nANNOUNCER: Now, what am I forgetting? Oh right! Lightning Bolt Lady’s great idea.\n\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: If I want to know my superpowers, I’ll need to learn about lightning!\n\nANNOUNCER: So, she read many books about lightning.\n\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Wow. A lightning strike usually lasts less than a second.\n\n(She tells this to a person and he slowly moves away.)\n\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Lightning is really fast and I like speed walking. So, maybe one of my superpowers is super-speed walking! (to stranger) Bye!\n\n(She begins to super-speed walk.)\n\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Check! Super-speed walking is definitely one of my superpowers.\n\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Lightning has millions of volts of electricity. Amazing!\n\n(She puts her hand up and lightning bolts shoot from her fingers.)\n\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Wow! I can charge a lot of batteries with this superpower!\n\nANNOUNCER: She had been looking for hours for someone to help when she found her chance.\n\nWOMAN: Hello? Hello? I’m sorry.

Thanks!\n\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: I’m Lightning Bolt Lady!\n\n(She takes the woman`s phone and shoots it with a lightning bolt. But it turns into ashes. Then, she gives the woman lots of money and smiles and says goodbye.)\n\nANNOUNCER: She had been practicing her superpowers all day.

I can also do this!\n\n(She tries to use her lightning bolts but it doesn`t go well.)\n\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Sorry! Let me do it again.\n\n(She lights the fire with her lightning bolts.)\n\nCHILDREN: Thanks, Lightning Bolt Lady!\n\nYOUNG MAN: Lightning Bolt Lady\n\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: You’re welcome. But you don’t have enough firewood. Using my super-speed walking, I will get more.\n\n(She super-speed walks around to get firewood.)\n\nPARENT: Lightning Bolt Lady, come back! A lightning storm is coming!\n\nLIGHTNING BOLT LADY: Not a chance! There’s not a cloud in the …\n\nCHILD: Lightning Bolt Lady, are you okay?\n\nCHILD: Where`s your super-suit?\n\nANNA: Oh no! I`ve lost my superpowers!\n\nYOUNG MAN: It`s starting to rain. Do you want to go inside and eat some S’mores?\n\nANNA: You read my mind.\n\nANNA: You know, I thought mind reading would be one of my superpowers.

She always wears a hat.\n\nPENELOPE: So, Anna, have you met the new consultant yet?\n\nANNA: No. But I’ve already heard. We look alike, don’t we?\n\nPENELOPE: Yeah, but you don’t act alike. You’re much nicer than she is.\n\nANNA: Maybe she gets nervous at new jobs. Or maybe she`s shy. Let’s not judge, Penelope.\n\nPENELOPE: She’s not nervous or shy. She’s mean.\n\nANNA: You know, we should get to know her better. Let’s invite her to lunch!\n\nPENELOPE: Sorry but I’m busy that day.\n\n(Penelope walks away. Anna yells after her.)\n\nANNA: Oh, that’s too bad. Hey, I haven’t picked a day yet!\n\nPROF. BOT: So, did you find anything? Here are a few things I found: Anna uses the words “look alike” to talk about the new consultant. She says, “We look alike, don’t we?”\n\nPROF. BOT: Penelope uses “than” and the comparative adjective “nicer” to compare Anna with the new consultant. She says, “You’re much nicer than she is.” Keep watching for more!\n\n(Anna and Pete are playing a game.)\n\nANNA: This is going to be so much fun. Boy, I can`t wait to play this game.\n\nEVILANA: How much longer are you going to be?\n\nANNA: We’ll be just a minute …\n\n(Anna turns around and sees her look-alike.)\n\nANNA: You must be Evelana. I’m Anna. We are look-alikes!\n\nEVILANA: No, we’re not. And my name is pronounced “Evil-ana.”\n\nPETE: Oh. This is going to be fun.\n\nEVILANA: You had better hurry up. I need this room for a lecture. It’s called: \"If You Want to Win, Others Must Lose.\" What is all this stuff, anyway?\n\nANNA: It’s a game. We’re going to play at lunch.\n\nEVILANA: It’s a stupid child`s game!\n\nANNA: It`s a fun game. But yes, it is for children.\n\nEVILANA: Well, you may be childish but I’m not. And you look stupid with that thing on your head.\n\nANNA: Well, you look serious with that look on your face. Come on, Pete. Let’s play somewhere else.\n\nPETE: Actually, I’m going to stay for Evilana’s lecture.\n\nANNA: Fine. You can learn new ways to beat people.\n\nEVILANA: He will. He will.\n\n(Days later, Anna and Penelope are playing the game. Pete comes in. He has a problem with his eye.)\n\nANNA: Okay. Am I a food?\n\nPENELOPE: Nope.\n\nPETE: Hey, do you guys have room for one more?\n\nPENELOPE: Sure, Pete! Come on over. What happened to your eye?\n\nPETE: Evilana “accidentally” hit me. And she didn’t even say sorry. She’s so mean!\n\nPENELOPE: I told you so.\n\nANNA: Here, Pete. Put on this headband. You’ll feel better. Penelope, you’re right. Evilana is an awful person!\n\nPENELOPE: And violent. And now we have to work with her!\n\nANNA: Haven’t you heard? She’s gone! She was given another assignment.\n\nPENELOPE: What assignment?\n\nANNA: I’m not sure. I think it has something to do with outdoors. Anyway, let’s play!

That’s unique.\n\nANNA: Yes, it is. In fact, I’m thinking of living on a houseboat.\n\nMS. WEAVER: Aren’t you too tall and klutzy to live on a houseboat?\n\nANNA: I am not too tall!\n\n(She knocks over a display board.)\n\nPROF. BOT VO: Is Anna really ready for a houseboat?\n\nPROF. BOT: Ms. Weaver invited Anna to dinner. When we make friendly, informal invitations, we use phrases like “Why don’t…?”\n\nPROF. BOT: For example, Ms. Weaver said, “Why don’t you join us? My treat!” That’s: Why don’t plus the subject plus the simple form of the verb.\n\nPROF. BOT: Anna responded to the invitation by saying, “Thanks, but I already have plans.” Keep watching for more examples of informal invitations!\n\nFANNY: Anna, I’m so glad you could come!\n\nANNA: Hi, Fanny!\n\nFANNY: Hi, this is my son, Phoenix.\n\nANNA: Hi, Phoenix.\n\nFANNY: How about you give Anna a tour and I will make some lunch?\n\nPHOENIX: Aye, aye, captain!\n\nFANNY: Great!\n\nANNA: Do you really call her “captain”?\n\nPHOENIX: I kind of have to.\n\nANNA: So, Phoenix, I think I’d like to live on a houseboat. Do you like living here?\n\nPHOENIX: I love it! It’s much different than living in a house.\n\nANNA: Oh, I bet. I bet you had to get rid of a lot of stuff, didn’t you?\n\nPHOENIX: No way! We moved from a 3-story house to a boat! So, we really had to downsize!\n\nANNA: I’d have to get rid of a lot of stuff. I have a rock collection and I have some really big rocks.\n\nANNA: Can you stop this boat from rocking for a minute?\n\nPHOENIX: No. We’re floating on water. I can’t do that.\n\nANNA: Well, since you live on the water, aren’t you afraid of great white sharks?\n\nPHOENIX: No, not really. They don’t live in these waters.\n\nANNA: … that you know of. What about killer whales?\n\nPHOENIX: No.\n\nANNA: Electric eels?\n\nPHOENIX: No.\n\nANNA: Barracudas?\n\nPHOENIX: No.\n\nANNA: Piranhas?\n\nPHOENIX: Uh-uh.\n\nFANNY: You know, Anna, if you’re afraid of sea life, maybe you shouldn’t live on a houseboat. Do you have any boating experience?\n\nANNA: Oh, oh yeah, Fanny. I have battled the great waters before -- once on a swan boat and once in a duck boat ... bus. It was a boat that turned into a bus.\n\nFANNY: Yeah, I don’t think that counts.\n\nANNA: Fanny, does this rocking ever bother you?\n\nFANNY: No, I love it. It goes up and down and side to side and up and down. Anna, I love it!\n\n(Because of the rocking, Anna begins to feel seasick.)\n\nFANNY: Anna, are you feeling okay?\n\nANNA: Yeah, yeah. You know, I just need some fresh air.\n\nFANNY: Let me open a window for you.\n\nANNA: No, I need some fresh land air. I mean, I need to breathe air on land. Oh, is that the time? I should really be going.\n\nANNA: Thanks for lunch, Fanny, and a tour of your houseboat. It’s given me a great idea!\n\nFANNY: You’re going to live on a houseboat?\nANNA: Sort of.

Ms. Weaver named me fire safety monitor.\n\nPENELOPE: But the only time we have a fire emergency is when someone burns a piece of toast.\n\nANNA: That is true. But fire safety is very serious – very serious.

There’s one really important thing you can do: Install a fire alarm. Test it monthly and make sure the batteries are fully charged.\n\nANNA: Let’s talk about those emergency exits.\n\nFF J: In your home, office and schools, know where your emergency exits are located.\n\nANNA: What about fire extinguishers?\n\nFF J: Everyone should know how to use a fire extinguisher. Have one handy and practice using it.\n\nANNA: What if we need to get out?\n\nFF J: You should have an evacuation plan. And practice getting out safely with fire drills.\n\nANNA: If I am in a building and it’s on fire, should I use the elevator?\n\nFF H: No. Always use the stairs.\n\nANNA: What other safety tips should I know?\n\nFF J: Stay low. Smoke rises. The air is clearer close to the ground.\n\nANNA: Stay low. Anything else?\n\nFF H: If you touch a door and it’s hot, don’t open it.
