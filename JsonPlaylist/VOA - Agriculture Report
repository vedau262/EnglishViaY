    "description": "Subscribe to the VOA Learning English Channel: http://youtube.com/voalearningenglish | Like us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/voalearningenglish \n\nFrom VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report.\n\nCassava is a very important crop in many countries. More than 160 million people across Africa depend on the plant for food or to earn money. The continent produces 60 percent of the world's cassava. In May, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reported that cassava production had increased by 60 percent worldwide since 2000. Agriculture experts had been expecting world cassava production to grow even more during the next 10 years. But those expectations have been crushed. Plant diseases are attacking cassava crops in East and Central Africa. Two diseases are the cassava brown streak virus and the cassava mosaic virus. The Food and Agriculture Organization says brown streak disease does more damage, since it affects the root of the crop. Luca Alinovi is the acting director of the FAO in East and Central Africa. He says the agency has taken steps to improve the situation, but the problem is not getting better. He says decisions on how to handle the problem will have a huge impact on the food security of people in Central Africa. Dominique Davoux heads the European Union Rural Development and Agricultural program in Kenya. She says the cassava diseases have changed over the years. She says early research slowed the disease but the disease changed form and new research is needed. The FAO says at least $100 million is needed to study the diseases and support clean farm production. Experts say failure to stop the disease means cassava disease will likely invade Nigeria, the biggest producer of cassava in Africa. For VOA Learning English, I'm Carolyn Presutti.",

    "title": "Debating How to Fight Hunger in Africa",
    "description": "Subscribe to the VOA Learning English Channel: http://youtube.com/voalearningenglish | Like us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/voalearningenglish\n\nFrom VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report.\n\nThe United Nations Environment Program says 200 million Africans go to sleep hungry. That number represents 23 percent of the population on the continent. A new UN study shows that eight out of 10 countries facing the worst food shortages are in Africa. Recently, African experts, farmers and others gathered in Kenya for two days of discussion. They debated ways to feed the growing human population in Africa and deal with rising temperatures on Earth's surface. The UN's Climate Change Coordinator for Africa, Richard Munang, was one of the speakers. He noted a need to increase food production to feed the population. But he said it is important to find ways to feed people without destroying forests, rivers, and seas that provide food.  At the meetings, Emmanuel Dlamini served as a negotiator for One Africa, a group that fights extreme poverty in Africa. In his opinion, climate change is here to stay. He says African governments and farmers have to look for ways to deal with the changes. Most African countries depend on rain to prepare their farmland and to start growing crops. For the past few years, a lack of rainfall has affected several countries, making their populations dependent on food aid. African farmers say that a combination of unpredictable rain and rising temperatures creates an environment for crop diseases that affects production. The conference also heard from a representative of Nestle, one of the world's largest food companies. Nestle Africa's Hans Johr says farmers need assistance from food processing companies and nongovernmental organizations. For VOA Learning English, I'm Alex Villarreal.",

    "description": "Like us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/voalearningenglish\n\nFrom VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report.\n\nFarming without big machines is hard work. Planting and fertilizing alone can take days in the hot sun. Researchers are working to develop simple machines to make life easier for farmers in the developing world. They would also like to help the farmers save money. Jelle Van Loon is testing a model of a hand-held planting tool designed for small-scale farmers. It is a long metal hoe with just two flat teeth. With each stroke, one tooth plants a seed; the other adds a little fertilizer.Jelle Van Loon is not a farmer. He is an engineer at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico. Mr. Van Loon is working to develop low cost tools for small scale farmers around the world. He hopes the tools will save them work, time and money. Usually he starts with a piece of equipment built somewhere else. An example is a hand-planter from Brazil. The long, wooden V-shaped tool has a piece of metal on the bottom for breaking up the soil. Opening the arms of a part shaped like the letter V loads seed and fertilizer into the metal tip. This tool is faster and costs less than planting by hand. It uses less seed and fertilizer. It can also reduce by half the time required for planting and fertilizing a two-hectare farm.  The planter still costs about $200 to make. Jelle Van Loon thinks the final product will cost less. However, he says, more work is needed. His team is now testing their fourth version of the planter. Mr. Van Loon says the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center will publish plans for the tool on the Internet after the group has finished its work.

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report. \n\nFarms are spreading to unused city lots and old properties across the United States. These urban farms grow crops in areas where people rarely buy fresh fruits and vegetables. They have the power to change what people eat. They also have the power to influence troubled neighborhoods. ECO City Farms is an educational, nonprofit organization in Prince George's County, Maryland. It seeks to help the local community by teaching economic development, job training and a healthier way of living.  \nThe group has set up farms near automobile repair businesses and fast food stores in urban neighborhoods. Social activist Margaret Morgan Hubbard founded ECO City Farms. She says the lack of fresh fruits and vegetables is a health problem for children and their families who live in nearby Bladensburg, Maryland.  \nECO City Farms offer several programs, including educational activities on agriculture, food and finding jobs with environmentally friendly businesses. People can also learn how to cook healthier foods and teach others how to prepare meals. \nRecently, Philip Sidibe demonstrated his cooking skills. He prepared aloco, a popular food in Cameroon, where he grew up.   \nHe and other young people not only cook their food, they also grow it in a large garden next to the Autumn Woods Apartments. \nMargaret Morgan Hubbard says the urban garden is an agent for change and the young people are its newest supporters. She says young people work throughout the year helping with the farm. They are not only farming food, but also making that food available to people who live in the community.

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report. \n\nIron deficiency anemia is the most common nutritional disorder in the world. People with the condition do not have enough red blood cells. As the name suggests, iron deficiency anemia results from a lack of iron. The World Health Organization says half the pregnant women and about 40 percent of preschool children in developing countries are not getting enough iron. Anemic adults cannot work to their full ability. And pregnant women who are anemic have a greater risk of problems during childbirth. Michael Hambidge of the University of Colorado is an expert on child health issues. He says the effects of anemia on children can be permanent. In a new study, Dr. Hambidge and others suggest that new kinds of grain may help reduce iron deficiency. They tested flour made from a special kind of pearl millet.The researchers used traditional crop breeding methods to increase the amount of iron in the pearl millet. The process is called biofortification. Researchers in India prepared meals with flour made from the biofortified millet. They used the meals to feed 21 children who had low iron levels. Then they compared these children to 19 others who received similar meals without the biofortified flour. The researchers found that children who ate the high-iron millet meals satisfied their daily requirements for the mineral. The other children did not. Experts say millet is a good crop to reach those in need of iron because it usually costs less to grow than other grains. It also requires little rainfall. The first high-iron biofortified pearl millet is already on the market in India. For VOA Learning English, I'm Carolyn Presutti.",

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report.\n\nIrrigation systems can make a big difference in agricultural production. Irrigation can also improve the lives of farm families.  However, a new study says bringing water to dry areas can also spread malaria. The study describes how irrigation water can lead to an increase in malaria cases -- an increase that can last for years. Malaria is spread by mosquitoes. The insects reproduce in standing water. So when a dry area is irrigated, the disease can appear and spread. Mercedes Pascual is a scientist at the University of Michigan. She and her team studied areas in northern India where irrigation systems were built over a number of years. They compared how malaria progressed with the spread of irrigation. She and the other scientists found that after farmers began irrigating their crops, the risk of malaria rose sharply. At first, the team thought the number of cases rose because there was little effort to control mosquitoes. But, the study found that was not the case. The researchers found that high rates of malaria continued for 10 years or longer even after mosquito control efforts were in place.  Mercedes Pascual suggests that irrigation projects need to limit places where mosquitoes might reproduce. She also says health officials may need to try other methods of malaria prevention that would work for long periods of time. The researchers agree that irrigation helps farming in areas with low rainfall. But, Mercedes Pascual and her team discovered that irrigation also can bring years of high rates of malaria. The only way to avoid the problem is through better planning and control measures. For VOA Learning English, I'm Alex Villarreal.",

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report. \n\nNew studies have found that a chemical commonly used to fight plant disease is harming honeybees. Experts say the chemical may be partly to blame for the widespread loss of honeybees in the United States. The insects are important to farmers. When a honeybee lands on a flowering plant, pollen sticks to its legs. When the bee lands on another flower, some of the pollen falls off and fertilizes the second plant. The act of pollination is important to the growth of many fruits, vegetables, nuts and other crops. Yet about 30 percent of honeybees in the United States and other areas have died in recent years. Dennis VanEngelsdorp is a researcher at the University of Maryland. He wants to learn why so many bees are dying. His research team examined pollen grains that honeybees carried to their hives. They found that the pollen contained high levels of 35 different pesticides -- chemicals used to kill insects. They also found that bees that ate some fungicides became infected with a deadly microorganism called Nosema. Fungicides are used to protect against fungi and are widely used for agriculture purposes in the United States. Mike Leggett studies pesticides for the pest management industry group CropLife America. He says many of the pesticides found in the pollen examined by Dennis VanEngelsdorp actually protect bees from Nosema. Honeybees are important to agriculture. This makes the search for an answer to their deaths especially urgent for Mr. VanEngelsdorp's team. As he notes, one in every three bites of food we eat is somehow pollinated by honeybees.

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report. \n\nOn World Environment Day in June, the United Nations reported that at least one third of all food produced is wasted. The report came at a time when many people are concerned about how to feed a growing world population. In the United States, farmers who are struggling to earn money find the situation difficult to deal with. The United States Department of Agriculture found that more than half of the small farms in California do not make a profit. One California farm family is using social media in an effort to change the situation and reduce wasted food. Nick Papadopoulos is general manager of Bloomfield Farms in Sonoma County. It was difficult for him to watch his employees returning from several weekend farmers' markets with top quality, unsold produce. Mr. Papadopoulos said he would find boxes of leafy greens, herbs and carrots left in a storage area. The vegetables would go bad before the next market day. As a result, Mr. Papadopoulos came up with a plan to offer the food at a low price by advertising it on the farm's Facebook status page on Sunday nights.The deals were open to anyone using the social media website. One week, several homeowners in a neighboring community bought the vegetables. Another week, the buyers were a group of friends. Nick Papadopoulos began using social media after he went to work on a farm belonging to his wife's father. After his success of using Facebook, Mr. Papadopoulos helped to set up a website called cropmobster.com. It is a place where people involved with food production can find surplus food for many causes. For VOA Learning English, I'm Alex Villarreal.",

    "description": "Subscribe to our channel: http://youtube.com/voalearningenglish\n\nFrom VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report.\n\nFarmers in the United States are experiencing two big problems. There is a shortage of people to work in their fields. The workers they do have are mostly from Latin America.  But many have entered the country with false documents. Farmers say that without immigration reform, both problems will continue. The Imperial Valley is an agricultural area in the western state of California near the border with Mexico. Temperatures there are above 38 degrees Celsius during the summer months.  As a result, not much grows in the Imperial Valley at this time of year.  But in the winter, the fields are filled with lettuce and celery.  And in the spring, farmers grow fruit like cantaloupe and watermelon.  There also is work to do in the fields during the summer. Francisco Saucedo uses farm equipment to prepare the land for planting in the autumn.  He lives in Mexico and wakes up in the middle of the night, so he can avoid long lines at the border crossing.  Mr. Saucedo says that if he did this kind of work in Mexico, he would earn about $6 a day.  But in the United States, he makes as much as $90 a day.Farmer Larry Cox says growing and harvesting vegetables depends on migrants, or day laborers, from Mexico.  But he says not enough laborers are crossing the border.  Mr. Cox says it is difficult to get visas to work in the United States.  As a result, many farm workers from Latin America carry false documents. Tom Nassif is president of the Western Growers Association, a U.S. farmers' business group.  He says there are about 11 million workers in the United States with false documents. More than one million of them work in agriculture. For VOA Learning English, I'm Carolyn Presutti.",

    "title": "In the Garden: Growing Chillies",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report.\n\nSome people say eating hot chili peppers can help you breathe easier if you have a cold. Others believe that chilies give you more energy. All we know is that people have been growing chilies for centuries. And there are plenty of different kinds of chili peppers to choose from. Want to spice up your meals with homegrown chilies? They need a warm climate. If you plant the seeds outside when the weather is cool, place a glass over them. That will add warmth from the sun and protect them from wind. You can also start the seeds in your home or a greenhouse. \nIf you plant chili peppers inside, fill an eight-centimeter pot with soil. The pot should have holes on the bottom so water can run out. Drop seeds over the surface of the container and cover with a thin layer of vermiculite. Vermiculite is a material that can hold air, water and nutrients. Then cover the top of the pot with a see-through plastic bag. Hold the bag in place with a rubber band. Place the pot in a warm area. You should take off the bag when the chilies start growing. When the plants have reached about two centimeters high, place each one in its own pot. When the roots show through the holes on the bottom of the pot, transplant each seedling into a 12 centimeter pot. When the plants are 20 centimeters high, tie the plants to a stick placed in the pot to support them. When the chili peppers are 30 centimeters high, pull off the tops with your fingers. That should get new branches to grow. When the first flowers show, give the plants some potash fertilizer. When the weather is warm, put them into five-liter pots and place them outside. Make sure they get lots of light and water. For VOA Learning English, I'm Alex Villarreal.",

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report. \n\nKenyan farmers say a British ban on the plant known as khat will seriously affect their businesses and economy. Exports of khat, also called miraa, are worth a lot of money to Kenya. The farmers have exported the plant mainly to European countries and Somalia. Khat is grown in the colder climates of central Kenya. For years, people have been using it as a drug. Chewing the leaves of the plant can increase the heartbeat and make a person feel more awake. Some Kenyan politicians and khat traders have called on the government to open talks with British officials to convince them to cancel the ban on khat. They say ending the ban would save Kenya's khat industry from collapse. Kipkorir Menjo is the director of the Kenya Farmers Association. He says the ban will affect tens of thousands of people.In July, British Home Secretary Theresa May banned the leafy stimulant. She warned that traders could use Britain to move khat illegally to other European countries. Khat is already banned in most European countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands. Kenyan traders exported about 20 tons of khat to the Netherlands weekly before the ban. Another 36 tons a week was sent to Britain. Kipkorir Menjo says khat farmers and traders need to speak up so that Britain can lift the ban.As the farmers and traders study the latest developments in Europe, another battle awaits them inside Kenya. The National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse is urging the government to list khat as an illegal drug. For VOA Learning English, I'm Alex Villarreal.",

    "title": "Debating Direct Payments to Farmers",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report. The United States Senate recently voted to cut a program that makes $5 billion a year in direct payments to farmers. But the Senate agreed to add new subsidies that critics say could hurt farmers in other countries. The vote was part of a $955 billion farm bill approved by a wide majority in the Senate. Ten days later, however, the House of Representatives defeated its own version of the farm bill. The Senate bill would cut about $24 billion from the federal budget over 10 years. Some of those cuts come from direct payments. Farmers receive direct payments whether they had good years or bad. But high crop prices and historically high farm profits have made the payments politically unpopular at a time of reduced federal spending.The Senate bill would help farmers manage the risk of bad weather and bad markets. It would do this by offering crop insurance to farmers raising crops that have not previously been insured. And it would make payments to farmers if prices drop too much. Supporters say the goal is to help the American farmers who supply the nation with food. But critics say the bill goes too far. Some say the proposed new guarantees to pay farmers if prices drop could cause trouble for the United States at the World Trade Organization. Other countries could claim that the policy suppresses prices in world markets. The bill would also let the government buy $60 million in emergency food aid closer to where a crisis is happening. Supporters say doing that is faster and cheaper than shipping food from the United States, and could save more lives. For VOA Learning English, I'm Mario Ritter.",

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report. Some countries have suspended imports of wheat from the United States. The suspensions were announced after an unapproved form of wheat was found in the state of Oregon. The crop was genetically engineered. An Oregon farmer recently discovered wheat in his field that survived the popular weed killer Roundup. Roundup is made by the seed and chemical company Monsato to destroy unwanted plants. The company has created genetically engineered corn, cotton, soybean and canola crops that resist Roundup. Monsanto field-tested Roundup-resistant wheat. But it never sold the seeds. Michael Firko is with the United States Department of Agriculture. He says the wheat passed safety inspections. Monsanto ended its wheat project because buyers in Europe and Asia were concerned about the safety of genetically engineered crops. The discovery of unapproved wheat in Oregon led Japan and South Korea to temporarily suspend some imports. The United States is the world's largest wheat exporter. But American agriculture has difficulty competing against other countries because production costs are higher in the United States. Mark Welch is an agricultural economist at Texas A&M University. He says the incident could affect America's place in the world market. United States officials are working to identify the source of the genetically engineered wheat. There is no evidence yet that it has entered the food supply. The Department of Agriculture is working to make tests available to wheat buyers.For VOA Learning English, I'm Laurel Bowman.",

    "description": "http://learningenglish.voanews.com | http://youtube.com/voalearningenglish\n\nFrom VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report. Agriculture produces a lot of the heat-trapping gasses that scientists link to rising temperatures and climate change. Agriculture also can be hurt by the effects of climate change. The Worldwatch Institute in Washington suggests ways that agriculture can reduce its effects on the environment. Worldwatch released a report called \"Innovations in Sustainable Agriculture: Supporting Climate-Friendly Food Production.\"  Researcher Danielle Nierenberg was one of its authors. She says 25 to 30 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture. This is because fertilizers, pesticides, antibiotic drugs, transportation and processing are all dependent on oil, gas and coal.Danielle Nierenberg says animal production has an especially big effect on the environment. She notes that more meat is being eaten in countries like Brazil, China and India. As a result, more industrial factory farms are being built in the developing world. The report recommends six land and water use practices that it says are sustainable. These include growing trees on farmland to reduce soil erosion and planting cover crops to protect soil from drought, heat and pests. Danielle Nierenberg says urban farming can help as well. Growing more food in cities can reduce transportation costs, she says. Urban residents then can buy food from within their communities. Other recommendations include recycling wastewater in cities, drip irrigation, and catching and storing rainwater. The United Nations estimates that changes in the agriculture industry could cut its carbon dioxide production by 88 percent. For VOA Learning English, I'm Alex Villarreal.",

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report. Farmers in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo are protecting against crop theft in an unusual way. The farmers are growing crops that are less likely to be stolen. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says in the past year many farmers have started to grow different crops. Guillaume Kahomboshi is a food security expert with the FAO in Goma. He says small farmers think the wars that break out at harvest time may just be an excuse to steal their crops. Mr. Kahomboshi notes that most of the people in Rutshuru, a territory near Uganda, are starting to grow soybeans.The expert suggests this is because soybeans are not good to eat until they have been dried and milled. He says the armed groups want food that is ready to eat. In addition, there is good demand for soybeans in Uganda for making biscuits and other processed foods. Farmers in Masisi, another war-stricken territory in Uganda, are switching to growing cassava. Franck Muke is an agronomist at Goma University. He agrees that soybeans are less likely to be stolen. But he is not so sure about cassava, which is called manioc in Congo. He says cassava is more of a risk because it is a staple food. Cassava is not necessarily easy to steal. But it is easily destroyed. The non-governmental organization Concern spoke with people in villages in Masisi. The group reports that there was less theft of cassava than of other crops. Years of war and ethnic conflict in parts of eastern Congo have divided communities there. This means villagers' crops are as likely to be stolen by their neighbors as by the armed groups.

    "description": "Subscribe to the VOA Learning English Channel: http://youtube.com/voalearningenglish \n\nFrom VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report. The United States Congress has been debating a new Farm Bill. This is a huge five-year plan that includes support programs for American farmers. Government payments make up eight percent of the income of farmers growing such major crops as maize, wheat, soybeans, cotton and peanuts. That eight percent is one of the lowest levels of support among developed countries. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says the average among its members is 20 percent. One reason for the low payments is high global crop prices. The price supports, or subsidies, that pay farmers when prices are low have not been used very much recently.Grain prices are high. Farmers have earned record or near-record profits in the past few years. But they still receive about $5 billion every year in what are called direct payments. These payments go to farmers whether crop prices are high or low. Farmers do not even have to grow a crop to get direct payments. Now, Congress wants to cut between $20 and $40 billion from farm subsidies. Even the largest farmers' group, the American Farm Bureau Federation, expects that direct payments will end soon. Mary Kay Thatcher is the chief lobbyist for the group. She says the payments are hard to justify politically. But there are proposals to increase subsidies once crop prices go down again. One version would let farmers receive payments with higher market prices. Another would protect a farmer's total income when prices fall. David Orden is an economist with the International Food Policy Institute. He says both versions would anger farmers in other countries. For VOA Learning English, I'm Laurel Bowman.",

    "title": "Straw Bale Gardening: Advice for Beginners",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report. Straw bale gardening is a way to grow food above the ground. Straw is what remains of plant stems after grain is harvested. The long, dry tubes are gathered into bales. Bales are often about a meter long and half a meter high and wide. Straw is different from hay. Hay is made from whole plants and used to feed animals. Straw is used mostly for animal bedding. Joel Karsten wrote a book called \"Straw Bale Gardens.\" He says this ancient, and increasingly popular, idea is a form of container gardening. He says using containers makes gardening easier by reducing the need to pull weeds and deal with insect problems. Joel Karsten says straw bales can require less water, and prevent plant diseases caused by too much water in the soil. He says it is not possible to overwater a bale of straw because all the extra water just runs out the bottom. In areas with polluted soil, growing food in straw bales is easier than building above-ground containers for soil. Oats and wheat are the most commonly baled grains in the United States. Rice straw is also good for baling and gardening. The straw bale becomes both the container and the growing material. Preparing the bale takes about two weeks. The first step is to add water and fertilizer to the center of the bale every day for three days. This begins the process of bacteria breaking down the straw into a growing medium. Once this happens, the bales are ready for seeds or young plants. Some experts say planting seedlings is better than growing from seeds. You can find plenty of information about straw bale gardening on the Internet. For VOA Learning English, I'm Alex Villarreal. (Adapted from a radio program broadcast 21May2013)",

    "title": "Cassava Virus Spreads to West Africa",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report.\nScientists and agricultural experts recently met in Italy to talk about how to fight cassava disease. A virus that has been killing this important crop in East Africa has now spread to West Africa. Experts are concerned that it could spread quickly throughout West Africa, including Nigeria. Nigeria is the world's largest producer and consumer of cassava. Cassava is a tropical root vegetable that requires little work. It grows well in poor-quality soil and high temperatures. The roots are full of carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. Cassava can also be used as an industrial starch to produce plywood, textiles and paper. Cassava is sometimes called a miracle crop for Africa. But plant \ndiseases have been a problem for about 100 years. One particularly bad virus is \ncassava brown streak disease. It began infecting cassava fields in East Africa 10 years ago. Now it has spread as far west as the Democratic Republic of Congo. Brown streak disease is spread in two ways: by white flies and by infected stem cuttings. Farmers use these cuttings instead of seeds to plant their fields. Claude Fauquet is a plant virus expert. He heads the Global Cassava Partnership for the 21st Century. He says it is hard to see signs of the disease in the plant itself. Instead, it becomes visible in the roots when the plant is harvested. He says scientists and organizations have to find a way to offer farmers virus-free plant cuttings. Claude Fauquet says scientists are experimenting with a virus-resistant cassava plant in Tanzania. Experts warn that brown streak disease could reduce cassava production in Africa by 50 percent. For VOA Learning English, I'm Mario Ritter.(Adapted from a radio program broadcast 14May2013)",

    "title": "Afghan Farmers Again Increase Poppy Crop",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report.\nAfghan farmers are expecting another big harvest this year, but officials at the United Nations and around the world see no reason to celebrate. The crop is opium. Farmers have been busy harvesting their opium poppies. One farmer in Helmand province says wheat and corn bring too little income. He says people in Helmand cannot feed themselves by growing food crops. A report by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime warns that Afghanistan could supply as much as 90 percent of the world's heroin. The report says opium production is especially high in the most unstable areas of Afghanistan. These are areas where the surge increase in American troops helped beat back Taliban influence.\nThe report says insurgents used the insecurity in areas like Helmand and Kandahar province as a chance to win popular support. They also assisted opium farmers with their crops. \nThe UN says poor weather and crop disease led to a reduction in the supply of opium last year, which drove up prices. The higher price of opium makes more farmers want to grow poppies.\n            The UN says this is the third year in a row that opium poppy-growing has increased in Afghanistan. A UN special adviser on drug issues says the huge opium crop is a sign of failure. He adds that while farmers are dependent on the income from opium, 1 million people in the country are addicted to the drug. The increase in production follows gains made by the government during years of effort to reduce the drug trade. For VOA Learning English, I'm Laurel Bowman.

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is Agriculture. The Go Green Initiative is a program for schoolchildren in the American city of Manassas, Virginia. It teaches earth-friendly behaviors, like recycling things instead of throwing them away. Nine-year-old Louis Delggado has learned why recycling is important. He says throwing things away without recycling makes the earth a dirtier place. Louis is one of more than 7,000 elementary school students taking part in the Go Green Initiative. The program receives support from the city government. Sandy Thompson is the program's coordinator. She says the Manassas schools recycle almost everything, from telephones to plastic bags. The schools use single stream recycling when possible. This means collecting paper, plastic and glass in one container instead of separating them.        Mike Moon is the city's director of public works and utilities. He says the goal is to raise awareness about recycling to keep Manassas clean. But he adds that Go Green is not just about recycling. He says it is also about energy and water conservation. Boys and girls also learn about gardening and composting. Composting turns uneaten food and kitchen waste into rich organic matter. Mike Moon says children often have never experienced these methods commonly used in agriculture.   Sandy Thompson says the lessons the children learn go beyond the classroom. She says they start their own gardens at home and recycle more. Ten-year-old Maria Seaburg planted a garden behind her home. She says she enjoys gardening and recycling because it helps the environment.  Mike Moon says good recycling behavior, taught at a young age, will last a lifetime.

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report.A listener in Nigeria asked us to talk about the moringa oleifera plant.  This tree or shrub is grown for food and other purposes.Gerry Moore is a plant expert with the United States Department of Agriculture.  He says the plant is high in protein, and rich in vitamins and minerals.  Not only the fruit, but also the leaves, roods and seeds can be used as food in some way.  The plant is known by different names around the world.  Moringa oleifera is native to the foothills of the Himalayas -- from Pakistan to eastern India.  Because it is native to that area, much of the research on the plant has been done by scientists in Pakistan and India. Its native range is narrow, but the plant is grown throughout the world.  In the United States, it has been introduced in Hawaii, Florida and Puerto Rico.  Gerry Moore says the plant cannot grow where there is freezing weather.  It resists heat up to 49 degrees Celsius.  The plant also can withstand dry or wet conditions, so it can grow in many areas.Mr. Moore says the plant can be used to make many different foods.  The leaves can be boiled and eaten in curry dishes.  The fruit can be sliced and eaten, cooked or pickled.  Gerry Moore says the taste is similar to asparagus.  The roots of the plant can be dug up, peeled and used as a seasoning in the same way as horseradish.  Moringa oleifera is related to mustard, so it can have a sharp taste.  The seeds in the fruit can be fried and taste like peanuts.  The seeds are rich in oil.  But the bark of the moringa oleifera tree can be poisonous, so be sure to remove it.For VOA Learning English, I'm Laurel Bowman. (Adapted from a radio program broadcast 9Apr2013)",

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report in Special English. To \"walk the talk\" means to keep your promises, to do what you said you would do. \"Walk the Talk\" is also the name of a new report by the International Food Policy Research Institute.  The group says there has been a lot of talk about fighting hunger, but not enough action. As a result, it says the international community could fall far short of the goal of cutting the number of hungry people in half by 2015. The report says an estimated 870 million people were hungry last year. Two billion did not get enough micronutrients -- vitamins and minerals.  Shenggen Fan is the institute's director general. He described 2012 as a mixed year for progress against hunger.He says African countries, India, China and Brazil continue to invest in agriculture. Donor agencies, he says, including the World Bank and USAID, have also increased their investment in food security and nutrition. But he says a lack of political will limited progress on food security. After the food crisis in 2008 and 2009, many promises were made to increase investment in smallholder agriculture. These small farms are often headed by women. Shenggen Fan says not all those promises have been kept. Supporters of greater agricultural investment in poor countries have often criticized farm support programs in rich nations. They say subsidies hurt food production and sales in developing countries. Now, many countries, including India and China, are also turning to subsidies. Shenggen Fan says that needs to change. He says it's time the international community walked the talk on food security.

    "title": "In the Garden: Growing Beets",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report. There's always work to do in a garden, but some plants need less work than others. Beets are a root vegetable that do not need a lot of care. People might think beets are always dark red. But they can also be pink, yellow or white. Beets are high in nutrients including folate, iron and fiber. They can be used fresh or frozen, canned or pickled. And not just the root but also the tops can be eaten. The leaves make good salads when the plants are young, and the greens can be cooked when the plants are older. Beets like cool temperatures, between 16 and 18 degrees Celsius. They grow best in full sun and in loose soil that is not too wet. Remove stones from the soil while preparing the ground. And test the soil before adding lime and fertilizer. Some experts say the best fertilizers for beets are low in nitrogen. Beet seeds can be planted as soon as the soil is able to be worked at the start of the growing season. Planting them every two to three weeks will provide a continuous harvest into the fall. A horticulture specialist at Iowa State University suggests planting the seeds a little more than one centimeter deep. They should be planted in rows that are spaced 30 to 46 centimeters apart. Overcrowding the plants will mean that the roots cannot spread out and grow. Thin the beets by removing the smaller ones. These can be used as greens. The only work needed once beets have been thinned is weeding and, when the weather is dry, a weekly watering. For best results, beets should be picked when they are four to five centimeters across. Beets much larger than that can be tough and have to be cooked for a long time. For VOA Learning English, I'm Laurel Bowman. (Adapted from a radio program broadcast 11Mar2013)",

    "title": "The Benefits of Companion Planting",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report. Companion planting is the idea that some kinds of plants can help each other grow. Plants that are compatible generally need similar soil, nutrients and moisture levels. Advice about which plants are compatible is sometimes based more on tradition than fact. But experts say there is evidence to support certain combinations. These can improve harvests, reduce disease and help control pests by attracting helpful insects. For example, some kinds of soil bacteria take nitrogen from the air and make it into a form that plants can use. The plants hold, or fix, the nitrogen in their roots. Legumes are especially good at nitrogen-fixing. Then any crops that share the same space as the legumes can get the nitrogen as the roots decompose.Beans and potatoes can also share territory well because their roots reach different levels in the soil. Deep-rooted vegetables get nutrients and moisture from lower down in the soil, so they do not compete with plants with shallower roots. But some plants placed together can harm each other's development. For example, tomatoes do not like wet soil, but watercress does, so you would probably want to keep them separated. Some kinds of produce should be kept apart even after being harvested. This is because of ethylene gas. Ethylene is a plant hormone that can cause some kinds of produce to ripen too quickly. This risk of ripening too soon is why markets often separate high ethylene-producing foods from those that are sensitive to the gas. But if you put an apple in a bag with a green banana, the ethylene from the apple will make the banana ripen sooner. For VOA Learning English, I'm Alex Villarreal.

    "title": "Europe's Horse Meat Problems",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report in Special English. Ikea recently recalled frozen meatballs from its European stores after tests found some contained horse meat. Czech investigators said they found small amounts of horse meat in Swedish meatballs at an Ikea store in the Czech Republic. Ikea is the big Swedish company that sells furniture. But its stores also sell Swedish foods. The packaging said the meatballs contained beef and pork. Ikea said meatballs from the contaminated batch were sent to stores in some other European countries.  They included Belgium, Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Greece and the Netherlands. Recently, laboratory tests found horse meat being sold as beef in a number of European Union countries. The EU law enforcement agency, Europol, is investigating the meat industry. Owen Paterson is the British environment secretary. He says the sale of horse meat as beef is unacceptable. He called it a fraud on the public. Millions of food items have been removed from stores, schools and hospitals. No one has reported any health problems, and the French eat horse meat. But the situation has upset consumers across Europe. In Britain, horse meat was discovered in frozen meals sold by the Swedish-based frozen food company Findus. In France, an investigation has accused the French meat processing company Spanghero of knowingly selling horse meat as beef. The company denies the accusation. The EU requires the packaging of fresh meat to identify the country where it was produced. But in prepared meals only the kind of meat used is required to be listed.

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report in Special English. People have been growing chrysanthemums for more than 2,000 years. Mums make bright and colorful gardens. People in China and other Asian cultures make tea with the flowers. Giacomo Puccini, the great Italian composer, even named one of his works after chrysanthemums, \"Crisantemi.\" One basic kind of mum is the hardy or garden mum. The other basic kind is the florist mum. The garden mum is better able to handle different growing conditions. The decorative mum is often seen in gardens. Another popular type, the quill mum, has long, straight petals like a tube or needle. Chrysanthemum blooms can be white, yellow, gold, red or other colors. Many of the plants grow to one meter high. The soil for chrysanthemums should be kept moist but well drained. Mums grow best in full sunlight. They produce colorful blooms when days get shorter and nights get longer. The life cycle of the plant depends on the amount of daylight. This is why experts advise against placing mums near nightlights or streetlights. The light may interfere with their normal growth cycle. As a result, the plants may develop buds too soon. In climates where temperatures fall below freezing, plant mums at least six weeks before the first frost is expected. That way, the plants will be well established for cold weather. To get more blooms, pinch back the branches when new growth has reached 15 centimeters. Squeeze about five to seven centimeters off each branch. Pinch it again when a branch grows another 12 to 15 centimeters. Stop the pinching about 100 days before you want the plants to bloom. For VOA Learning English, I'm Carolyn Presutti.

    "title": "Growing Vegetables in the Shade",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report in Special English. Have you ever thought about planting a garden, but didn't think you had a spot with enough sunlight? Well, not all vegetables need a lot of sun. Mark Hoffman and his wife, Guia, own a guesthouse in Kempton, Illinois. They often serve their guests produce fresh from the garden. The Hoffmans have been growing food and flowers for 25 years. For much of that time, Mark Hoffman has been experimenting with shade plantings. He says visitors to his website, greenhousebed.com, often ask how to plant in the shade. There are a lot of choices.For example, he grows tomatoes near oak trees. Big oak trees can produce a lot of shade. But Mark Hoffman says his tomato plants grow, as long as they get five hours of direct sunlight each day. He also plants asparagus around a tree at its drip line. That is the area below the outer limit of the branches. The Hoffmans' website includes a list of vegetables, flowers and herbs that have produced acceptably for them in partial shade. These include broccoli, daylilies, horseradish, Irish potatoes, oregano and winter onions. Mark Hoffman says plants with wider leaves seem to do better in the shade. He also finds that his potatoes do better in partial shade than in full sun. Time of day, brightness of the sun and shadows from trees, walls and buildings all influence how much or how little sunlight falls on plants. Curtis Swift at Colorado State University says people interested in shade planting should also remember something else. The term \"shade\" can describe different amounts of darkness -- and it can even mean different things in different parts of the world. For VOA Learning English, I'm Carolyn Presutti.

    "description": "Avoiding Future Famines in Somalia From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report in Special English. The humanitarian situation in Somalia has improved. United Nations officials say the improvement is the result of new methods of aid delivery, more rainfall and success against militants. Luca Alinovi is head of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization for Somalia. He says the situation has changed in a sustainable way. But he says those gains are at risk if the international community fails to support the Somali people. He warns of a possible return to conditions like those in 2011. That was when a famine emergency was declared in parts of Somalia. Many people died. Many others walked for weeks to reach areas with food and water. Luca Alinovi says the FAO used cash-based interventions to help during the famine and the season after it. He says the aid effort urged Somalis to stay where they were. Earlier interventions, he says, were based more on simply providing food, shelter and other basic needs. Twenty twelve was a good year for rainfall in Somalia. Two major rivers cross the country. So, irrigation can be used in a lot of areas. Luca Alinovi says continued investment in irrigation could increase agricultural production to meet the needs of more than half of Somalia. Another issue affecting the humanitarian situation has been the success against the militant group al Shabab. Forces from the African Union, known as AMISOM, along with those from the Somali government and Kenya have driven militants from many areas.  But, Luca Alinovi says many rural areas remain under al-Shabab's control and the military operation continues. For VOA Learning English,I'm Alex Villarreal.

    "title": "Reducing High Rates of Wasted Food",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, welcome to Agriculture in Special English.  How much of the world's food is going to waste?  The Institution of Mechanical Engineers released a report that says as much as half of all food is wasted.  The Britain-based group says that must change if the world is to feed its growing population.  Every year the world produces about 4 billion tons of food.  The report says that between one third and one half of it goes to waste.  It says that in Southeast Asian countries, between 37 and 80 percent of all rice production is lost. Colin Brown helped write the report for the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.  He says a lot of rice is lost because of the way it is harvested, stored and transported. The developed world also wastes food.  The report says more efficient farming methods ensure that more food reaches markets.  Still, Colin Brown says millions of tons of food are thrown away because it is past its sell-by date or for other reasons.  He says a lot of food is thrown away because it no longer looks good, and not because it is no longer good to eat.A spokesman for a group that represents supermarkets in Britain says the big food stores are not to blame.  He says they are only following European Union marketing rules.  The stores have been pushing for an easing of those rules.  He says that in 2009, stores succeeded in getting a number of rules relaxed.  Many aid organizations welcomed the report.  They say it shows how much food is being wasted at a time when millions of people do not get enough to eat.  The group Save the Children says there is enough food in the world to feed every child.  Yet, 2.3 million children die every year as a result of hunger. For VOA Learning English, I'm Laurel Bowman.(Adapted from a radio program broadcast 05Feb2013)",

    "title": "What Makes a Plant a Weed?",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, welcome to Agriculture, in Special English. I have a question for you: When is a plant considered a weed? Well, the experts at Penn State University have a simple answer: When the bad qualities outweigh the good qualities. Consider the fact that crops produce several hundred seeds from each plant. By comparison, each weed plant can produce tens or even hundreds of thousands of seeds. And some buried seeds can survive up to 40 years or longer. Eradicating, or getting rid of, weeds means that you have to remove all the seeds and roots so the plants will not grow back. But birds, wind and weather can bring them back to the land. A more common way to deal with weeds is to control them so that the land can be used for planting. Experts advise using two or more control methods.  Chemical weed killers or natural treatments like corn gluten can suppress weed growth. Dense planting of a crop can also act as a natural control. Bill Curran is a professor of weed science at Penn State University in Pennsylvania. He says one of the most common methods for suppressing weeds is dense planting. He says a dense, competitive crop that quickly shades the soil will help. The weeds need light to grow, so blocking the sun will reduce their growth. Other controls include turning over the soil, pulling the weeds or covering them with mulch made of shredded wood, garden waste or other material. But even mulch has its limits. Weeds can be transported in mulch. This is also true of soil, grain, hay and animals. Animals like sheep or goats eat weeds, so they can provide a biological control. Even insects and other organisms can also act as biological controls. For VOA Learning English, I'm Carolyn Presutti.",

    "title": "New Rules Aim to Improve Food Safety in US",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, we bring you news about agriculture, in Special English. Each year, bad food sickens about one in six Americans. But, proposed new rules raise hopes to improve food safety. Officials say the changes could prevent more than 1 million cases of food-related illnesses each year.The new rules were proposed recently, exactly two years after President Obama signed the Food Safety Modernization Act. The rules are the first step in putting that law into effect. They represent the biggest changes in food safety since the 1930s. The new law makes the Food and Drug Administration responsible for preventing foodborne illnesses. Experts say this is a change in the way that the FDA has dealt with disease outbreaks in the past. Congress passed the law after a series of outbreaks that were linked to spinach, peanut butter and other foods. The agency is proposing to require food manufacturers to show that they have identified where contamination is most likely to happen. Manufacturers would also have to show that they have taken steps to prevent problems. The proposed rules also deal with safety in growing and harvesting fruits and vegetables. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that establishing all of the provisions of the law will cost the government $1.4 billion. The Grocery Manufacturers of America, an industry group, has not released an estimate of what it will cost producers. But FDA Deputy Commissioner Michael Taylor says the new rules are worth the cost.  He says there should be reductions in illness and disruptions in the food supply, and increases in buyer confidence. He says, when these issues are considered, the benefits outweigh the costs of the new law.  For VOA Learning English, I'm Alex Villarreal . (Adapted from a radio program broadcast 22Jan2013)",

    "title": "Ideas for Climate-Friendly Food Production",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report in Special English. Agriculture produces a lot of the greenhouse gasses that scientists link to rising temperatures and climate change. Agriculture can also be hurt by the effects of climate change. A new report says high temperatures and unpredictable weather are disrupting agriculture in many parts of the world. The report is called \"Innovations in Sustainable Agriculture: Supporting Climate-Friendly Food Production.\" The Worldwatch Institute in Washington published it. The report suggests ways that the agriculture industry could reduce its effects on the environment. Danielle Nierenberg was one of the report's authors.  She says industrial agriculture uses a lot of fossil fuels. She says the chemicals used in fertilizers, pesticides and transportation depend on fossil fuels.                                                       Danielle Nierenberg says animal production has an especially big effect on the environment. She notes that the amount of meat being eaten in countries like Brazil, China and India is growing. As a result, more industrial animal facilities or factory farms are being built in the developing world. Those big farms need fossil fuels to operate. They also require long-distance transportation.  She said all those things can contribute to climate change. The report recommends six land and water use practices that it says are sustainable. These include growing trees on farmland to reduce soil erosion and planting cover crops to make soil less affected by drought, heat and pests. Other recommended practices include recycling wastewater in cities, drip irrigation, and replacing chemical with natural fertilizer. For VOA Learning English, I'm Laurel Bowman.

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report in Special English. \n\nThe United Nations says in 2012, aid agencies treated a record number of children in the Sahel area of West Africa for severe acute malnutrition. The United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, says many of them were saved from the life-threatening condition. Severe food shortages and drought have increased malnutrition rates in the Sahel. UNICEF says about 850,000 children received emergency food aid and other medical treatment in 2012. The agency says undernourishment, which is a lack of important nutrients, is partly responsible for more than half of child deaths in the Sahel. Malnutrition increases the risk that a child will suffer diseases like diarrhea or malaria.Felicite Tchibindat is UNICEF's nutrition advisor for the Sahel. She says preventing malnutrition is very important during the first two years of a child's life. She says malnutrition can also affect a child's risk of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. Felicite Tchibindat says malnutrition has an economic effect as well.  She says the World Bank estimates that the area's economic productivity lost two to three percent last year because not enough was done to prevent malnutrition. UNICEF says malnutrition is more than not getting enough food. It is about not getting the right food, especially during the first two years. UNICEF is also urging mothers to breastfeed, and it supports efforts to guarantee clean drinking water. It is educating parents about the importance of feeding their children protein, and vitamin-rich fruits and vegetables. For VOA Learning English, I'm Carolyn Presutti .

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report in Special English. Tall or short, fat or thin, natural, plastic or metal. Whatever the choice, the National Christmas Tree Association says Americans bought over 40 million Christmas trees last year. Christmas trees are grown and harvested in all 50 states. Christmas time in the city usually means buying trees already cut and waiting to be sold. But some people like to drive to tree farms. Others wait for their tree to come to them, or they order one from the pages of a catalog or even on the Internet. Some say the easiest thing of all is to buy an artificial tree with Christmas lights already on it. The National Christmas Tree Association represents growers and sellers of most of the farm-raised Christmas trees in the United States. The group estimates that 9.5 million artificial trees were sold in 2011 compared to almost 31 million natural ones. So, people still enjoy the appearance and smell of natural trees more. The group says people paid an average of around $35 for a natural Christmas tree and twice as much for an artificial one. But artificial trees, which mostly come from China, can be re-used for years. Most natural trees are cut up and recycled, but some people buy trees that can be planted. The association says 16 percent of people who bought natural trees last year chose them at a farm and cut the tree themselves. 84 percent bought them already cut. Most Christmas trees are now grown on farms instead of in forests. The trees take 6 to 10 years to grow. In some states, less than half the planted trees survive the weather conditions to become someone's Christmas tree. For VOA Learning English, I'm Alex Villarreal.

    "title": "How Poinsettias Flowered Into an American Favorite",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report in Special English. Poinsettias are the best-selling potted flowering plant in the United States and, they are a traditional part of Christmas celebrations. That is why almost all of them are sold in the wintertime. The Department of Agriculture estimates that Americans bought $250 million worth of poinsettias last year. The poinsettia is native to Central America and needs warmth to grow. Bright red poinsettias are the best known. But there are about 100 different kinds, in colors including white, pink, yellow and purple. The flowers of the poinsettia are very small. Around the flowers are colorful leaves called bracts. These bracts are what give the plants their beauty. The poinsettia is named for Joel Roberts Poinsett from South Carolina. In 1825 President John Quincy Adams appointed him as the United States' first minister to Mexico. He saw the colorful plants growing in the wild there. He liked them so much that he sent some cuttings back to the United States. People who are allergic to the latex produced by rubber trees can develop a mild skin rash from poinsettia plants. Babies and pets that chew on the plants can get sick. But experts say the plant is not as poisonous as some people think. Then, there is the question of how to say poinsettia. Do not be surprised if you hear someone say \"poin-set-uh.\" Both pronunciations are common. In the 1920s, Albert Ecke and his son Paul became interested in the poinsettia's ability to flower in winter. Paul Ecke thought it would be a good plant for Christmastime. They started a farm in California. Today, Ecke Ranch remains a major supplier to the United States and the world. For VOA Learning English, I'm Laurel Bowman .

    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report in Special English. Gordon Sato traveled to Eritrea for the first time in 1985. The Japanese-American cell biologist wanted to see what he could do to help the people in their struggle for independence from Ethiopia. On his trip, he noticed that camels were eating the leaves of mangrove trees growing along the coast. He planted more mangroves so they could be used to feed livestock. But at first, all the new trees died. Then Gordon Sato observed that mangrove trees only grew naturally where there was fresh water some of the time. The fresh water provided minerals that salt water lacked. Gordon Sato found a way to provide these minerals.  He put nitrogen, phosphorous and iron into small plastic bags at the base of each tree. Holes in the bags released the minerals into the soil over time. The women in the village of Hargigo started to feed the leaves of the mangroves to their sheep and goats. But the animals were not producing enough milk for their babies. Gordon Sato asked the villagers to grind the remains of fish and spread this fish paste on the leaves. This provided protein for the sheep and goats so they could produce more milk. Today there are more than one million mangrove trees around the village. Gordon Sato has also started a large garden in Mauritania to grow more mangrove trees. He says, \"You don't have to be brilliant to do useful work.\"  All you have to have is moderate intelligence and determination, and you can make a contribution to this world.\" Gordon Sato called his work in Eritrea the Manzanar Project.  The name is meant to honor Japanese-Americans placed in the Manzanar relocation camp in California during World War II. For VOA Learning English, I'm Carolyn Presutti.

    "title": "In South Africa, Armed Guards for Rhinos",
    "description": "From VOA Learning English, this is the Agriculture Report in Special English. Some private game farmers in South Africa are hiring armed protection for their rhinos. New security companies are being started to fight an increase in rhinoceros poaching. Poachers are now well-armed and well-financed. A single horn sells for than $65,000 per kilogram. That is more valuable than gold. Rhino horns are sold mostly in Vietnam and China. People there wrongly believe that the material in the horn can cure all kinds of problems. Simon Rood started a security company in South Africa five years ago, when rhino poaching started to increase. His 35 rangers supervise an area of 150,000 hectares in Limpopo province. Simon Rood was a soldier in the South African army, and gives military training to his rangers. He says they have never lost a rhino to poaching. This, he says, is because his rangers patrol 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and live and sleep in the countryside. Callie Botha manages a wildlife business that had six rhinos. Recently he found one dead, with its horns cut off. He owned the rhino for 12 years. Replacing a rhino costs about $28,000. But Callie Botha says armed protection also costs a lot, and he worries about his own safety. So he may stop breeding rhinos. He says, \"The risk is too high. \"Other wildlife businesses are willing to pay to protect their rhinos. Karen Trendler works at South Africa's only rhino orphanage. She thinks there should be a law to establish rules for training.  If security companies are not well-trained, she says, there is a risk of corruption. She says a long-term solution will come through education and law enforcement. For VOA Learning English, I'm Carolyn Presutti.",
