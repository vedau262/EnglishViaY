Do you have any suggestions?\"\nSTEVE: \"The weather is going to be nice. You should do something outdoors.\"\nGREG: \"Yeah, it's supposed to be sunny all weekend.\"\nSTEVE: \"How about a picnic at the park?\"\nGREG: \"We do that often. I want to do something more fun.\"\nSTEVE: \"How about the city zoo? I heard that bear cubs were recently born there.\"\nGREG: \"That's a good idea. We haven't been to the zoo in a long time.\"\nSTEVE: \"Then you should definitely go this weekend.\"\nGREG: \"The last time we were there, it started raining. None of the animals wanted to come out.\"\nSTEVE: \"That must've been boring.\"\nGREG: \"It was boring. The kids wanted to go home early.\"\nSTEVE: \"The animals should be more visible since the weather is going to be sunny this weekend.\"\nGREG: \"Yeah. I think we will go to the zoo. Hopefully, this time it'll be more fun.\"\nSTEVE: \"Actually, I have four tickets to the zoo. You can have them. Our family won't be able to go. The tickets expire this weekend.\"\nGREG: \"Thanks, Steve! Let me pay you for them. Zoo tickets are expensive.\"\nSTEVE: \"Don't worry about it. It's my gift to you since your last visit was not fun.\"\nGREG: \"Are you sure! This is very generous of you.\"\nSTEVE: \"Also, you mowed my lawn a few times after I had back surgery last year. I really appreciated that.\"\nGREG: \"I'm glad we're neighbors.\"",

What's wrong?\"\nHELEN: \"I couldn't sleep until 3 o'clock in the morning.\"\nJOAN: \"Why? What happened?\"\nHELEN: \"Our neighbors' children threw a big party last night. The music was so loud.\"\nJOAN: \"Wow! Where were their parents?\"\nHELEN: \"They are on vacation. They left the kids home.\"\nJOAN: \"How old are the kids?\"\nHELEN: \"They're teenagers. They're old enough to be home alone.\"\nJOAN: \"Did you complain to them?\"\nHELEN: \"Yes! I went over there three times. I told them that their music was too loud and we were trying to sleep.\"\nJOAN: \"What did they do?\"\nHELEN: \"Nothing. They wouldn't turn the music down.\"\nJOAN: \"That is so rude! Why didn't you call the police?\"\nHELEN: \"I finally did. The police found some of the teens drinking alcohol.\"\nJOAN: \"I bet that ended the party.\"\nHELEN: \"Yeah. Now my neighbors are heading back home from their vacation.\"\nJOAN: \"Do they know what happened?\"\nHELEN: \"Yes. They are not happy. Those kids are in big trouble.\"",
